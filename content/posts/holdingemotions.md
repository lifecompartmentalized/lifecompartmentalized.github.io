I like to go on evening walks for exercise. I typically walk one of a few routes

One day this past summer, I walked by a person who had some of the same characteristics as someone who caused me harm in the past. I walked by this individual without awareness that I was at all triggered. Then, in a split second, they started yelling at me. 

"You're scared of me, huh? What do you have to be scared about?"

_What?_ It was so out of context for me; I had no idea why they were yelling at me. I wasn't scared of them---up until they started yelling at me, I hadn't even noticed them. I ignored them and calmly kept walking in the direction I was going. Then, they started chasing after me [^1], continually yelling at me. 

[^1]: Thankfully, they used a walker, so I was in little danger.

"Why are you scared of me? You think I'm threatening? There's nothing to be scared about!"

_Yeah, sure. You're chasing and yelling at me. Clearly there's something to be scared about_.

I sped up walking and continued ignoring them. I felt very calm while this was happening, although I was confused by what going on. I eventually made it to the next block over and lost sight of them. I calmly walked home, and went out of my way to reassure myself that I had done nothing wrong, and that the person was at fault, not me. But _why_ did this person think I was scared of them? Was I scared of them? 

As it turns out, a part of me _was_ scared of them. When I saw that person, that part became so scared, that they momentarily took control of my face and made a scared microexpression, directed at that person. However, I had no awareness that I was scared of them or that I had made any facial expression. This is because the parts of me who were on my evening walk had amnesia for the part of me that was scared of the person, so from the perspective of the part of me that was going on a walk, I had no idea that anything abnormal was happening, while the scared part was simultaneously terrified.
