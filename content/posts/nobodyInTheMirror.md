A commonly reported symptom of DID is that when one looks at themselves in the mirror, they don't recognize themselves---they see a stranger in the mirror. This could likely be attributed to dissociation from their body, possibly because a part of that they don't recognize is active.

I had a similar experience
While researching 
At the beginning of my DID discovery journey, this was not something I personally 

I didn't ever have the experience of not recognizing myself in the mirror because when I'd look in the mirror, I never saw _me_. Instead, I would connect with my reflection in the third person---I would see _someone else_, not _me_. I did not grow the capacity to connect with my external appearance as _me_, since in my childhood, it was to my advantage to detach entirely from my life in first person. 

I grew up in an incredibly controlling household

I grew up in an incredibly controlling household---no individuality or freedom of expression was tolerated. Instead, my mother chose all aspects of my life for me

My mother controlled every aspect of myself---she chose the clothes I wore, and even cut my hair to her own liking.


This is something
When I looked at myself in the mirror, it was purely for, I never looked at myself and saw _me_, I looked at myself more from an outside observer's perspective---to see if my body looked socially acceptable. 
In fact, I've spent much of my life in third person. to holding a third person perspective of self.

The first part of me to connect with my first-person self was a young part of me, one who I had disowned when I was small in order to conform to the rules of my home environment.
