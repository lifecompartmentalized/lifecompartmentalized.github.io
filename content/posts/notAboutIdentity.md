... it's about childhood trauma. 

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is coping mechanism one can develop when they experience repeated trauma in early childhood. It is arguably one of the most misunderstood and controversial mental health conditions, perhaps because it's been repeatedly sensationalized in the media. Or, maybe because the name and clinical description of the disorder implies that it's about having multiple identities or personality states. However, these personality states are often incredibly subtle and are instead indicative of a post-traumatic reaction involving severe compartmentalization of experience.

DID is a highly individualized disorder which forms based off of one's reaction to their life experiences. As such, I can only speak for myself on how I personally experience this disorder. While DID can be difficult to understand, it's fundamentally about two psychological phenomena---_detachment_ and _compartmentalization_. Using myself as an example, when I was small, there were times where I experienced extreme repeated abuse[^1], but otherwise had a happy childhood. While I was being abused, I mentally _detached_ myself from the situation---I disconnected from my body and the external world, choosing instead to escape into my mind to distract myself from a situation I knew no other way to get out of. Then, after the abuse was over, I internally _compartmentalized_ the experience and shoved it from my awareness, effectively allowing me to forget that it occurred as I lived an otherwise happy childhood. Because this abuse occurred repeatedly, I continually used this strategy of switching to the compartment of awareness and experience that held the abuse when I experienced triggers that the abuse was going to happen again. Then, when the abuse was over, I would switch back to the compartment of awareness and experience that had a happy childhood. All of this was done on a subconscious level.

[^1]: This extreme abuse occurred outside the home. However, I did experience less severe abuse and other traumas within my family which shaped my development of this disorder as well.

This strategy of detachment and compartmentalization can only develop when trauma occurs in early childhood, while the brain still is rapidly developing and has the capacity to use such defenses. And because I learned to use these defenses when I was very young and my brain wired based on my experiences of the world around me, I learned that this was a very effective strategy for minimizing psychological discomfort. 
Because of this, over time my threshold for what constituted compartment creation lowered as I relied more and more on this coping mechanism.
Detaching from the world around me allowed me to regulate how much of my surroundings I experienced, which has been particularly helpful as an autistic person with sound and light sensitivities.
Because I was able to compartmentalize my experience, I subconsciously learned to separate the good aspects of my life---like emotions of happiness, contentment, and good memories---from the bad aspects of my life, like anger, sadness, and memories of bullying or 

This has been an incredibly effective strategy in emotional regulation for me. In fact, my dynamic range of emotions is so low, that my main emotional state exists solely of mild contentment, which I seemingly experience most of the time.

Because of the internal compartmentalization, the parts of me who lived a normal childhood did not remember the events that occurred to the parts of me who experienced trauma. This allowed my compartments that experienced life to grow and thrive as a child, while my other compartments held the hurt and pain of the abuse. 
This led to 

While many individuals with this disorder may only experience a split in traumatized vs untraumatized parts of their personality, 

As I became older and was no longer actively encountering abuse, because it was so deeply engrained in how I operate, I still used this part creation strategy to aid in every day life.

Detaching from the world around me was a way I learned to regulate myself. For example, because I am autistic, I have sound and light sensitivities.

This became a highly effective strategy---I learned to dedicate parts of me to handling abuse, and other parts of me to learning and growing as a child.

Yet, perhaps because of the name, or the media representation, 

When I started therapy almost 14 months ago, I genuinely believed that dissociative identity disorder (DID) was a fake disorder that people feigned to get out of trouble or for attention. My understanding of DID was influenced by the social and traditional media representation of the disorder, which generally portrayed people experiencing drastic personality shifts, or seemingly role-playing characters. I never thought this disorder could apply to me---for the most part, I was soft spoken, reclusive, and tried my hardest to blend into society. However, as I know now, I am a typical, but not stereotypical, example of how DID presents.

So it's not about identity. Having multiple identities is a side effect of the extreme internal compartmentalization caused by trauma. But because it's the most sensational part of the disorder, that's what it's known as.
