In January 2022, I started trauma therapy. I had no idea what I was getting myself into---I knew I had a traumatic childhood, but I didn't yet understand how much my past experiences had affected me in the present. When I started therapy, I thought dissociative identity disorder (DID) was a fake disorder people feigned for attention. It sounded too fantastical to be real, and my logic-driven mind couldn't comprehend how 

However, my understanding of the disorder was severely flawed, influenced by both traditional and social media. In reality, I was a perfect case example of what DID looks like before one is aware. Most noteably, I had no idea I was even symptomatic.
