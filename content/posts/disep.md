While I do experince what one could call "dissociative episodes" where a part takes full control of my body for a period of time, most of the time I experience momentary episodes of dissociation, where a part only takes control of my body for a few seconds at the maximum. I like to call these blips.


Momentary moments of dissociation, where a part will very briefly take control of my body, are quite common for me---they occur several times a day.
Sometimes, a thought will pop up in my head that very momentarily pulls me away from the present. 
Sometimes, this thought p
Sometimes, this part

For that brief moment, my concentration is entirely focused on the inside part. Simultaneously, my face and/or body are moving how the part.

From the outside, all of this happens so fast that if you blink you might miss it. Or, you may think it a tic, or a flinch. Personally, I try to hide them so they're as undetectible as possible to the outside observer---I don't want to let others know what I'm experiencing.
