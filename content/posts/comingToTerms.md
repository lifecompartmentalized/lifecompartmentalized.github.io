It took me several months of therapy with a dissociative disorders specialist in order for me to even consider that I had DID, despite having a pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis. Like many others would in my generation, as soon as I realized I was being assessed for DID, I immediately went to sites like Reddit and YouTube to see how other people with this disorder conceptualize their experiences. Needless to say, I did not relate to others' experiences that I found online. Most people I had encountered seemed to have a relatively small number clearly defined parts with clear roles. I genuinely did not believe that I had DID, despite the fact that I was frequently dissociating in therapy sessions without realizing I was doing so. 

Then, about 4 months into therapy, I noticed my first switch. It was incredibly subtle, but as I was working at my desk I noticed I momentarily started to dissociate, to detach from the world around me, and then all of a sudden everything became clear again. And I felt internally different. _Did I just switch?_ I then went back to working and noticed that my handwriting had changed. _Why?_ Upon noticing this, I switched again. It was once again incredibly subtle, but I looked back at my notebook, and tried to pick up where I had left off. Yet again, my handwriting had changed. I started panicking. _What is happening? Am I switching?_ Then I switched again, and felt calm. By then, that part of me knew I was switching, and that I must have DID. Of course, it would take me several more months for all of my parts to be updated.

, and that my disorder was going to be more complex than the clean switching between well-defined parts that I was used to seeing in social and traditional media. This was my first known occurrence of what many in the community call "rapid switching", and is something I would experience on a near daily basis after that.

I, for the most part, have very little identity alteration between parts. To me, it seems like my one singular identity is fragmented into discrete pieces rather than me being the current part that I am, and other parts being different to me. I do have some parts which feel distinctly different than the mass of parts I consider to be _me_, but a majority of the time, I feel like I have a singular sense of self, with the same personality. But that sense of self is extremely fragmented.

So, the question remains: why do I have so many parts?
