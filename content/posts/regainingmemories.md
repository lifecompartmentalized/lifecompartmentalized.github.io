There's a lot about my life that I do not remember. However, until learning that I have DID, I wasn't aware that I had any memory problems. I honestly never bothered to look back too much in my past---I genuinely thought I had a happy, wonderful childhood, because the good memories were the only ones that I had owned as my own experiences. Now, since starting therapy, I realize there's so much more to my life that I am unaware of. As I've been processing my life 

My narrative of my life is always changing, as I'm learning more about my past---about who I was and who I am becoming. I am a product of my life's experiences, both the ones I've owned and ones I've disowned, even if I don't remember them yet.
