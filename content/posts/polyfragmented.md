The word I like best to describe my flavor of DID is polyfragmented. 
Polyfragmented is most commonly referred to to mean someone who has a lot of parts and/or splits parts in a complex manner. I believe I exhibit both.

In a more traditional case of DID, it is my understanding that a person has a relatively small number parts that are more well defined. They only have a few compartments of memory, thus allowing them to spend more time in each compartment, so each compartment has more time to develop a distinct way of being. Their switches between these parts seem to be more pronounced since each part is more well defined.  

I believe I experience something different. In addition to having several well-developed main parts, I also seem to have many fragments, or much less developed parts. It seems like, for the most part, these parts represent smaller fractions of my life than someone with a more traditional presenting form of DID. I have more parts, along with more fragmentation and less differentiation since each part had less time to develop a distinct identity. 
[^1]: They may have nicknames, but not many do. There are too many of them for it to make sense for them to have names. Plus, naming parts of myself with human names other than my own doesn't feel comfortable for me.

Why do I have so many parts? I believe it's because the threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals---things that would be considered traumatic to me may not affect another person as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, life experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, because I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there's a high correlation between those who are polyfragmented and are autistic [^2].

[^2]: I came to this conclusion from r/DID and r/OSDD on Reddit

I've also learned that I have many different splitting patterns.
One such splitting pattern is that, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to split many parts in a sequential manner, which leads to a lot of parts being created for a single event.
I also do not only split parts due to trauma---I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged [^7].


[^7]: until I stop relying solely on dissociation as a coping mechanism, which I'm actively working on doing in therapy.



Rather than working with one part at a time, I'm working with clusters of parts at any given time[^5]. 
I do not seem to have a "host", or primary, personality. Instead, I have one of a few clusters of parts active at any given time, which seem to change from week-to-week and month-to-month in an approximate cyclical pattern.
My parts do not have names---they have labels[^1].
I shift and switch[^6] between these parts at least a few dozen times a day, even without being triggered, because I have parts I need to access as a normal part of every day living[^10]. 
Since my threshold for creating parts is so low, I believe I am still creating parts in the present-day.
My system isn't neatly organized and structured. It's chaotic, messy, and unknown.
[^5]: Some people call these subsystems. I seem to have many layers of compartmentalization---my parts have their own parts.
[^6]: I use _switch_ to denote a hard, discrete change between parts, which usually occurs when I'm triggered and can be disorienting. I use _shift_ to denote a smooth change between parts, which occurs more often than switching for me and can internally feel like a gear shifting in my brain.
[^10]: I have many task-based parts, or parts that serve a specific job in my life, which leads to me needing to shift or switch between parts on a very regular basis.

Now, while this may sound like a difficult way to live---and in many aspects it certainly is---I believe the language used to describe this disorder makes it sound a lot more severe than it feels internally, at least to me. 
I have had DID my entire life, and I have, for the most part, lived an enjoyable and conventionally successful life despite this. I know no other way of living---this is normal to me. 
However, because of my system structure, I struggle with many aspects of time and memory[^8], such as knowing what day, month, or sometimes year it is when I wake up in the morning, remembering what I did yesterday, or even 5 minutes ago, and losing anywhere from minutes to weeks of time due to a trauma trigger. 
My internal awareness of my life is also shuffled, so I may have a hard time differentiating what happened yesterday versus what happened last week or last month, or struggle with remembering if, for example, a cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday.
It can feel like every day a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I left off yesterday. 
This can affect my daily functioning significantly.
Only since learning that I have DID and gaining the language to describe my experiences did I know the way I experience the world is different from most others, and could be considered disordered. However, this is my normal, and always has been.

[^8]: My symptoms include more than just time and memory problems, but those aren't explicitly due to my system structure, and may be addressed in later posts.

It's taken me just over a year of therapy to get to the awareness I have today, and I know there's so much more I'm unaware of. 
When I take a step back and look at the facts of my situation, I can objectively see that I should be having a difficult time right now. However, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview. 
My body is designed to deal with trauma, and learning about and working with my messy system could be considered just another trauma I'm getting through.


Having polyfragmented DID makes my life very chaotic. I do not know how many parts I have, nor do I think I will ever know. I have to be okay with the unknown and be open minded about the information I learn about my system. I've always lived this way---I just wasn't aware about it until now.
