The truth is, it's complicated.
What one constitutes as a "part" is a deeply personal choice, along with the [language one chooses to describe their system](/posts/language/)[^1].
After all, we have to reduce something as complex as the human experience to concrete words in order to convey our experiences to others---it's an imperfect translation.
In this post, I speak only for myself in explaining how I experience what I call parts.

[^1]: I want to acknowledge that not everyone likes parts language, or the word system. There are an endless number of ways to conceptualize ones experiences. In this post, I share only mine.

It seems that the common narrative amongst people with dissociative disorders is that a part is human-like. That is, a part has the properties of a person, such as an age, individual characteristics, and likes/dislikes. 
To me, this is sometimes true. 

While I do have many parts who I perceive as human-like, I have many that do not seem to fit this. I believe building from the narrative that parts each have their own clearly defined boundaries of personhood is too complex for many of my parts.
This may be due to the fact that I am [polyfragmented](/posts/polyfragmented/), so I have a lot of "fragments" rather than fully fleshed-out parts.
Instead of seeing parts as human-like, I choose to see parts as different compartments of various aspects of my experience that I can either be connected to or dissociated away from at any given moment. These aspects are separated from one another in a discernible way. That is, I am usually only aware of one aspect at any given time, and many of these are contradictory to one another.
I can generally categorize parts as different compartments of four aspects of my life: awareness, memory, experience, and identity. 

<!--Experience is how one perceives the world around them. Awareness is how knowledgeable they are about the world around them.-->

### Compartments of awareness
In the first case, when these parts act as different compartments of awareness, I may only be aware of different aspects of my life's circumstances or what is happening in the world around me at any given time.
 For example, when one part of me is active, I genuinely may not be aware that I am a graduate student that's supposed to be working on my PhD. When this part of me is active, I am totally detached from the adult responsibilities---I am free of stress. I have other parts who are acutely aware of the stresses of being a grad student, and others who do the work to 
The fact that I have compartmentalized and separated my awareness of my life's difficulties is protective---I can suspend my awareness of stressful things so I can move on with other areas of my life. However, it can become maladaptive as it becomes easy to not address the difficult things I am detached from, making them compound until they're unmanageable.
When something becomes too difficult for me to manage, I can effectively just constrict my awareness of my life until I don't have any awareness that the difficult thing is happening.

### Compartments of memory
These parts also act as different compartments of memory. I seem to have many separate compartments of memory that I switch between. When one part is active, I fill up that part's memory bucket, and when I switch, I store my memories in a different compartment. This 
Rather than having a 
In the past, I have had friendships that were unhealthy. In these, because I had separated the good memories with the person vs the bad memories with them, I either saw them as all good or all bad at any given time---it made it difficult to see the nuance in the relationship. 
I like to think of this as an extreme version of state-dependent memory, in which the correct parts have to be out in order for me to remember what is 

### Compartments of experience

### Compartments of identity
Finally, these parts can be different compartments of identity. This is perhaps one of the most well-addressed ways in which parts present.
To me, a parts can be different "personas" that I slip into when necessary. This isn't a conscious choice---whatever part of me is active is out for a reason. 
As an example in my system, I have many parts who identify as the standard adult me, although who that adult me differs in 

Before awareness that I had DID, when any given part was out it felt like that was the version of me that I always was---I didn't realize that I could be any other way.


A lot of my parts are different permutations of who I could be. Because I have dissociative barriers between different aspects of myself, rather than a singular, unified personality forming based off of all of my life's experiences, I had several different personalities form, each holding different life experiences that shaped their formation. So I may have a compartment only for 

As a result, I feel as though the dynamic range of my whole personality is larger than that of someone without a dissociative disorder.


The only discernible difference between these two parts may be my awareness---I 


A personality develops based on one's innate temperament and their life experiences. It seems that since my life is separated into many compartments of different aspects of my experience, I now have multiple discretely different personalities, or ways of interacting with the world around me, instead of one continuous integrated one.

What is a part? It seems like it's all of the above. The way I experience each "part" seems to differ from part to part. Part is a universal word to describe all these experiences, but it's really just a label. 

<!--

As another example, there are times in which I can easily, and unintentionally, ignore pain and discomfort. I can contract my awareness away from the site of pain 

This is another reason why I like parts language---I am one individual human with a complex internal world, just like every other human. I have parts. I believe, however, the degree of separation between my parts is much more severe than someone without a dissociative disorder. 
A part can have the essence of a human, and I often have the experience of feeling like there are multiple people who reside in my body, all trying to do different things. 

Rather than being too simplistic, I belive using this narrative makes my parts seem more complex than how I perceive them.


The truth is, I don't know. But I can tell you how I experience what I call parts.
In reality, part is just a 
It seems whoever I perceive myself to be is the part with the strongest influence, but 

What one constitutes as a "part" is a deeply personal choice, along with what words they choose to describe what I call a part.


After all, something as complex as the human experience can't be concretely described by words. 

After all, we have to reduce something as complex as the human experience to words to be able to concretely describe it using words.

which may or may not have the properties of humanhood. 

I generally see parts as different compartments of awareness, experience, memory, and identity. 

In the second case, parts can act as different compartments of what I refer to experience, or how I process information in the world around me. 

How DID impacts my work.
For example, I very easily disconnect from the awareness of my current life circumstances if they are too stressful for me. I can go hours, days, or weeks without awareness of certain aspects of my adult responsibilities, such as work, if they becomes too stressful. The worst part is I don't even realize that I am doing it---the trigger of something being too stressful automatically causes me to ignore it on a level that's beyond my conscious awareness. In this case, part of my life, the part that focuses on work, is no longer in my conscious awareness. It is only when the situation escalates to being
This is dangerous as it allows for my life to easily pass me by without me even being aware of it.

 For example, when one part of me is active, I may genuinely believe that my life is going swimminlgy, and that nothing is wrong. I am not aware of any negative aspects of life---I am naive. When a different part is active that is more aware of my entire life's circumstances, I may have a more nuanced view that life is challenging right now, even if I'm enjoying much of my current circumstances.
