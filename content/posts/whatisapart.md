The truth is, I don't know. But I can tell you how I experience what I call parts.

What one constitutes as a "part" is a deeply personal choice, along with what words they choose to describe what I call a part.

What is a part? It seems like it's all of the above. The way I experience each "part" seems to differ from part to part. Part is a universal word to describe all these experiences, but it's really just a label.
