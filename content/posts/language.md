Have you thought about how you conceptualize your internal experience, or the language you use to describe it? I personally hadn't given either much thought until I learned I had DID. Since then, I've had a long journey of learning to understand how I operate, which has required me to think deeply about how to convey my experiences to others who likely do not operate in the same way that I do.

How one chooses to explain how they operate is complex and deeply personal.
As such, different people with DID may choose to convey their experiences in many different ways. 
While some people are extremely creative in their portrayals of how they operate, I am someone who is more reluctant to portray myself in a way that others may deem as being too imaginative.
Because of this, I'm still trying to find the language that feels most appropriate to describe my experiences.

The language one chooses is influenced by the underlying model that they use to understand what they are experiencing.
My experiences with DID seem to vary greatly, and range in severity depending on if I'm experiencing a trauma trigger or not.
On the severe end, when parts take over my body, it can feel like I'm being possessed and another being is controlling me. 
On the other end, most often switching and shifting between parts feels so natural to me that I wonder if my experiences are even different than the norm. 
To me, it seems that both these mundane and extraordinary experiences can be explained by the model of me switching, shifting, and being influenced by different compartments of memory and experience, which I call parts.

With time, I have realized that I see the world with multiple different perspectives---while I have the perspective of me as a whole person, I also see the perspectives of me as my individual parts. 
The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm. 
On this blog, and when I discuss with others about my experiences, I typically portray the perspective of myself as a singular unified person as it's likely how the vast majority of people see themselves, but this language can be limiting to describe my experiences. 
Writing from the perspective of me as a whole, these "parts" seem to be compartments of many different aspects of my life, such as memory and  identity, that I switch between to navigate through life. 
For the most part, I only have the perspective of one part at any given time[^2], and due to my degree of compartmentalization between parts, including amnesia and severely changing understandings of the world, depending on which compartment I am in I may have very different perspectives and things to say.
If I only portray myself as one singular unified person, I am misrepresenting aspects of my experience.
Thinking and writing as if I am a system of parts can enable me to explain experiences that simply don't make sense from the more restrictive whole-self perspective, like changing views about a topic, lapses in memory, possession-like experiences, losing time, and even quirks like handwriting and gait changes between parts. 
[^2]: Although, as I'm creating connections between parts, this is thankfully changing!

Since starting therapy, I've gradually learned to internally reference myself as a system of parts, yet I still translate that to a singular-self language when talking with others as I am hesitant to externally display my internal perspective with others.
I like portraying having a unified, singular-self view of life, even though it doesn't fully reflect how I've learned to perceive myself. 
This is probably due to the fact that it makes me uncomfortable realizing others know that the way I internally refer to myself is different than the norm.
When I was young, I was more in-touch with my individual parts' perspectives---I would often refer to myself in third person in conversation with others[^1]. I eventually learned that others did not experience themselves in this way, as I was occasionally ridiculed for it. I learned to hide using this language, even though it was the most accurate language for my experiences, since it was not well received by others.
Perhaps because of this, I feel the same way about using other unconventional language to describe my experiences---speaking from the perspective of individual parts, like I naturally did when I was younger, is tainted with shame due to my past experiences, and something I'm working towards getting more comfortable with when appropriate in order to become more authentically me.
[^1]: This is because I have many parts who perceive my life in third person, and when those compartments are active, I naturally refer to myself in third person.

While I am used to thinking in third person[^3], thinking about myself as multiple is new[^4], and I'm still getting used to this conceptualization and the language used to describe it.
On this blog, I have decided to use whatever language is most appropriate for describing the particular experiences that I'm trying to convey---I don't want to limit myself to a particular conceptualization or vocabulary set. So while I have mostly written from the perspective of a unified self thus far, this may change as I learn what language and conceptualization feels most comfortable for me. 

[^3]: This is useful for trauma survivors since it allows a detached view of self---one can perceive themselves as the observer of a situation rather than a participant in it. 
[^4]: I didn't know this was an option, and it didn't come organically to me like the third-person perspective did. Now that I am more aware this is how I operate, I see that it aligns very well with my experiences.

How do I find the vocabulary to describe experiences that are can be either so mundane or extraordinary?
grow more comfortable with the language that feels most authentic to me. 

it made myself and others uncomfortable. 

On this blog, I have decided to use whatever language is most appropriate for describing the particular experiences that I'm trying to convey---I don't want to limit myself to a particular conceptualization or vocabulary set. So while I have mostly written from the perspective of a unified self thus far, I hope to write with more diverse views in the future.

In order to have a more accurate view of my life, I need to look at things from the perspectives of my individual parts. 


Looking at things from the perspectives of my individual parts,
While I have learned to internally reference myself being a system of multiple parts of self, I am hesitant to externally display this perspective with others. 

With time, I have begun to realize that I have two main ways of conceptualizing how I operate---I experience both the perspective of me as a whole person, as well as the perspectives of me as my individual parts. The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm. While this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with this view.

I never have a complete view of my life unless I take a step back and realize that there are things I may not be aware of at any given moment.
I may write from the prospective of my parts, or me as a whole, or a combination of both. 

Or how you perceive the world around you

I may strongly believe that an individual is an amazing person and a good friend, only to later see the red flags of my relationship with that person 

Have you thought about the language you use to describe your internal experience? I personally hadn't given it much thought until I learned I had DID. 
How one chooses to conceptualize their experiences is deeply personal, both for those with and without a dissociative disorder.

so my perspective as a whole person is influenced by which compartment I am currently in.
 since I only have the perspective of the part I currently am
---each part of me has its own perspective, which may clash with my whole-self view 
How does one convey their internal conflict, switching and influence of parts, 

But this leaves me in a tough spot---how do I to convey my experiences that are different than the norm while still trying to stay within the language 
hesitant to portray myself differently from 

To me, most of these conceptualizations of DID seem 
I view these conceptualizations as metaphors to describe ones internal experiences. 
With DID, different people conceptualize their internal experiences
I have a deeply divided, messy 
my parts have a complex internal relationships. What do I convey this to others?

For me, it is often difficult to put into words the experiences I've been though because of DID. 


While using only this view this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with having a unified perspective.
