Most of the time, I cannot tell apart my parts. But I'm getting better at it

at it, but it's much more subtle for me than it sounds. 

My switching and shifting between parts isn't new. What is new is my awareness of it. 
I've been switching and shifting between these parts my entire life, except I was unaware of it until now. 
To me, switching is a normal experience---

What does switching feel like? Well, it depends on the kind of switch.

I'm getting better at telling apart 

I seem to have a giant mass of parts, who all identify as "me". Some parts are distinctly different enough from this mass that they've been able to differentiate themselves[^1]

[^1]: Or I've been able to differentiate them, depending on how I look at it.
