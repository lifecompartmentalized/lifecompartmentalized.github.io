One of the stereotypical signs of DID is having discrete switches between personality states, which I refer to as parts or compartments. For me, externally, this may look like an abrupt change in behavior and demeanor, but most of the time it's undetectable unless you know what you're looking for. Nobody in my life has ever noticed me switching unless I've pointed it out to them after the fact---it's typically very discreet.

Internally, the feeling of switching varies. Up until about a year ago, I was switching between parts on a daily basis without being aware I was doing so---it was normal to me. Even now, most of the time, I don't pick it up on switches.
