One impactful but not immediately obvious symptom of DID for me is that I do not seem to have a continuous internal sense of time---my awareness of my life is shuffled. 
Because of this, I may have a hard time differentiating what happened yesterday versus what happened last week or last month,
or struggle with remembering if, for example, I have leftovers in my fridge now or if that was from weeks ago.
This has made things like tracking changes in my environment difficult. 
For example, I have had spring-time allergies for much of my life, but I was unable to realize that until recently---every day in the spring, I'd wake up with allergies, but to me that was just accepted as fact. I didn't remember that I had allergies yesterday or every day last week, or that I didn't have allergies last fall, or that I've had allergies every spring since childhood. All I am aware of is that I have allergies in that moment. Only since concretely tracking my symptoms this year was I able to determine that I do have springtime allergies, despite having them for years.
Life really feels like a blur to me.

I believe these experiences can be explained by my system structure, and 
are heavily impacted by the fact that I am [polyfragmented](/posts/polyfragmented). 
I seem to switch between compartments a significant amount on a daily basis, and I have many parts that only seem to come out every few days or weeks. Since what is at the forefront of my awareness depends on which memory compartment I'm in, and many of these compartments, or parts, only come out once in a while, the end result seems to be that my understanding of my life is very shuffled.

I've been operating like this for my entire life without awareness that most others do not have such a shuffled awareness. 
I'm glad that I finally understand that I have DID and that I operate in this way, as it provides me language to contextualize my experiences and a path forward to healing. With time, I hope to gain a more broad view of my life and form a more continuous relationship with time.




<!--In undergrad, I had two main handwritings, but in grad school my handwriting has become much more inconsistent. Furthermore, because of the way I've split work parts, I can see in my academic journal that, over the span of several months, I'm writing the same things down over and over again, all in different handwritings. I'm trying really 


When I wake up in the morning, I never know which part of me will be active---it seems to be different most days, so I wake up almost every morning with a different internal sense of how to operate in the world. Throughout the day, as other parts come out, my priorities and interests are shifted elsewhere, directed by what the current part wants to be doing. Externally observing my behavior, when I'm alone I discretely switch from task to task in a somewhat chaotic manner.
Because I only have the awareness of the current part, this jumpy behavior feels natural to me as I follow my switches.


cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday. 

My plants in my home don't seem to grow---to me, it appears like they abruptly jump in size. 


I now have way more parts than jobs. For example, I went from having two main work parts in my undergraduate years to an uncountable number of work parts in graduate school[^1], making 
[^1] I can see this by looking at my handwriting

When I switch, it can feel like a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I just left off. Because I do not have much differentiation between my parts[^3], I often don't realize I've switched---I may just abruptly do something different to what I've previously been doing without awareness that I should be doing something else. For example, I may be working and switch to a part with no awareness of work, so I'll go do something else while that part is out and it's only when I switch to a part with awareness of work do I realize I wasn't working when I should have been. 
[^3]: I'm actively working on learning how to internally differentiate between my parts so I can sort this mess out.


I have an extremely constricted, compartmentalized awareness so that at any given time, I only have a partial understanding of my entire life, and my ability to track time between parts varies. 


It seems like I only have a full sense of time surrounding the compartment I currently am in, and when I switch between compartments it can feel like time restarts[^1].
[^1]: This seems to depend on how much the parts are familiar with each other. Some switches, which I like to call shifts, feel nearly seamless, while others, between parts who have more amnesia for each other, can feel more jarring.

For most of my life, having such a constricted awareness has been useful.
For example, as a child, this allowed me to have a compartment for when I was in an abusive situation, and a different compartment for when I was at school. Separating these experiences was beneficial---it made it so that when I was at school I had no awareness of my abusive environment, so it didn't affect me as much.
When I was in school, I was able to focus on school, and when I was in an abusive situation, I was able to focus my energy on getting through it. Separating these worlds allowed me to learn and grow as a child while simultaneously experiencing abuse. 
It seems like the shuffling of my sense of time is a side effect of my constricted awareness.

Now as an adult, I've continued to live my life in such a compartmentalized way that I'm only fully aware of what is currently going on in the compartment I am in---I've learned to live life in the moment-to-moment, without a more broad awareness of my past and future.

This level of constricted awareness has made my day-to-day functioning difficult.

I learned how to split parts and compartmentalize experiences as a coping mechanism as a young child, and because it was so effective, I've continued to use it as an adult. For me, what started as a beneficial coping mechanism seems to have gone out of control as I've used this strategy to cope with adult stressors. As a result, I now have many parts that I switch between on a regular basis with varying degrees of awareness between them. When I was younger, I seemed to have a much more structured and organized system, with each part having a unique job. Now, my system is much more chaotic, with multiple parts vying for the same job. So, for example, I have multiple different work parts that don't have full communication between them, so I can do one session of work as one part and then when I inevitably switch to a different work part, I may have difficulty picking up where the last part took off. This wasn't always the case---for most of my undergraduate years, I only had 2 main work parts who seemed to work well together. I only created many work parts when my work became a major source of stress in graduate school. Now, I have countless work parts with that don't have full awareness between them[^2].

[^2]: This can be verified by looking how my handwriting has changed through the years.
Externally, this appears that I am slacking on my work responsibilities, but in reality the intention is different---sometimes I genuinely do not know I am supposed to be working.

However, the way I seem to experience this is incredibly subtle.
How does this affect me?
it allows me to only be aware of the activities current environment that I am in. 
 It seems as though if Part A is active for  a period of time and Part B takes over, when Part A is active again (or, when I am in Part A's compartment of memory again), stuff that occurred when Part B was out feels like it occured longer ago than when Part A was active.
I suspect that others with more identity alteration would 

These experiences are just subtle enough for me to question if they are actually significant, or if everyone experiences them and I'm just being . 
Because the way I navigate throughout life involves switching between compartments of memory, and when I'm in one compartment I may remember different things about my life due to what I experienced while I was in that compartment of memory in the past, my awareness at any given time is constricted.

When the abused part was out, I would be able to focus all of my energy on minimizing the abuse, 

. What exactly I'm aware of depends on which memory compartment I'm in.
