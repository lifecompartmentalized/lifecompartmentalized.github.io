Have you thought about how you conceptualize your internal experience, or the language you use to describe it? I personally hadn't given either much thought until I learned I had DID. Since then, I've had a long journey of learning to understand how I operate, which has required me to think deeply about how to convey my experiences to others who likely do not operate in the same way that I do.

With time, I have begun to realize that I experience both the perspective of me as a whole person, as well as the perspectives of me as my individual parts. The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm. While this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with this view.

On this blog, and when I discuss with others about my experiences, I typically use the perspective of myself as a singular unified person as it's likely how those who do not have a dissociative disorder see themselves. However, this language can be limiting to describe my experiences. 
Writing from the perspective of me as a whole, these "parts" seem to be compartments of many different aspects of my life, such as memory and  identity, that I switch between to navigate through life. 
For the most part, I only have the perspective of one part at any given time [^2], and due to my degree of compartmentalization between parts, including amnesia and severely changing understandings of the world, depending on which compartment I am in I may have very different perspectives and things to say.
If I only write as if I am one singular unified person, I am misrepresenting my whole experience.
Writing from the perspective of the parts can enable me to explain experiences that simply don't make sense from the more restrictive whole-self perspective, like changing views about a topic, lapses in memory, losing time, and even quirks like handwriting and gait changes between parts. 
[^2]: Although, as I'm creating connections between parts, this is thankfully changing!

For the most part, I internally reference myself as a system of parts, and translate that to a singular-self language when talking with others as I am hesitant to externally display my internal perspective with others.
I like portraying having a unified, singular-self view of life, even though it doesn't accurately reflect how I've learned to perceive myself. 
This is probably due to the fact that it makes me uncomfortable realizing others know that the way I internally refer to myself is different than the norm.
When I was young, I was more in-touch with my individual parts' perspectives---I would often refer to myself in third person in conversation with others [^1]. I eventually learned that others did not experience themselves in this way, as I was occasionally ridiculed for it. I learned to hide using this language, even though it was the most accurate language for my experiences, since it made others uncomfortable. 
Perhaps because of this, I feel the same way about using other non-conventional language to describe my experiences---speaking from the perspective of individual parts, like I naturally did when I was younger, is tainted with shame due to my past experiences, and something I'm working towards getting more comfortable with when appropriate in order to become more authentically me.
[^1]: This is because I have many parts who perceive my life in third person, and when those compartments are active, I naturally refer to myself in third person.

While I am used to thinking in third person[^3], thinking about myself as multiple is new[^4], and I'm still getting used to this conceptualization and the language used to describe it.
On this blog, I have decided to use whatever language is most appropriate for describing the particular experiences that I'm trying to convey---I don't want to limit myself to a particular conceptualization or vocabulary set. So while I have mostly written from the perspective of a unified self thus far, I hope to write with more diverse views in the future.


[^3]: This is useful for trauma survivors since it allows a detached view of self---one can perceive themselves as the observer of a situation rather than a participant in it. 
[^4]: I didn't know this was an option, and it didn't come naturally to me like the third-person perspective did. Now that I am aware this is how I operate, I see that it aligns very well with my experiences.

In order to have a more accurate view of my life, I need to look at things from the perspectives of my individual parts. 


Looking at things from the perspectives of my individual parts,
While I have learned to internally reference myself being a system of multiple parts of self, I am hesitant to externally display this perspective with others. 

With time, I have begun to realize that I have two main ways of conceptualizing how I operate---I experience both the perspective of me as a whole person, as well as the perspectives of me as my individual parts. The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm. While this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with this view.

I never have a complete view of my life unless I take a step back and realize that there are things I may not be aware of at any given moment.
I may write from the prospective of my parts, or me as a whole, or a combination of both. 

Or how you perceive the world around you

I may strongly believe that an individual is an amazing person and a good friend, only to later see the red flags of my relationship with that person 

Have you thought about the language you use to describe your internal experience? I personally hadn't given it much thought until I learned I had DID. 
How one chooses to conceptualize their experiences is deeply personal, both for those with and without a dissociative disorder.

so my perspective as a whole person is influenced by which compartment I am currently in.
 since I only have the perspective of the part I currently am
---each part of me has its own perspective, which may clash with my whole-self view
