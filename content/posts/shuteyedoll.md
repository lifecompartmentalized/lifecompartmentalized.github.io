On the bookcase

In the corner of the room

Quiet

Watching

Just as I should be

The shut eye doll

<br>


All dressed up

Silk and lace 

No motive 

No voice

Only eyes

And a painted on smile




<br>

Controlled

Coddled and pampered

Maneuvered and manipulated

It's for my worst

It's for my best

I am a shut eye doll

<br>

Sitting quiet

Sitting still

Feeling unheard

Feeling unreal

Detach

Feeling nothing


<br> 

Under her watch

Under her control

I am happy

I am blessed

Life is good

Porcelain and curls




<br>

Is she watching?

Is she there?

Am I real?

Can I think?

Can I move?

Can I do?


<br>

She's back

Get in position

Smiles

Wide eyes

Back straight

Beautiful


<br>

Silly me

She's always there

Always watching

Always controlling

It's for my best

It's for my best


<br>

I am a porcelain, shut eye doll

Always watching

And being observed

Under her control

In the corner of the room

I am her shut eye doll


<br>

<!--

Quiet

On the shelf

Watching

No voice

Only eyes

I'm nothing without her 


<br>

"oh how cute!"

"do it again!"

"look at the camera!"

"make big eyes!"


attentive 

happy 

quiet

happy


smiles bright 

attentive 

happy 





<br>

But it's not just me 

there are others too

it was her before 

<br>
