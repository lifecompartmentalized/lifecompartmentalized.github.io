My relationship with my DID diagnoses---both with regards to accepting it as my diagnosis and seeing how it has affected me---has changed significantly since starting therapy. 
Over the past approximately 1.5 years, I've been through several distinct stages of recovery. 

#### Stage 0: Buildup to starting therapy (October 2021--January 2022)
In October of 2021, I had what I thought were a series of panic attacks due to a highly specific trigger of trauma that I experienced as a child.
I met with a psychiatrist at my school who, upon hearing of my symptoms and pediatric mental health history, likely immediately knew that I had a dissociative disorder and recommended therapy. 
They connected me with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders, who I started working with in January 2022.

At this time, I genuinely did not know what DID was. I was aware I experienced depersonalization [^4], and that I had some strange psychiatric symptoms in my childhood, but I thought I was mentally healthy other than that panic associated with a trigger. I started therapy with the hopes of stopping the inconvenient panic attacks, and came in with the intention that I'd only be in therapy for a year or so. I had no idea what I was signing up for.

[^4]: I've experienced what I label as depersonalization since I was very small. At age 4, my mom documents me telling her that I felt like a doll, that I didn't feel real. Throughout my life, the severity of my depersonalization has fluctuated significantly.


#### Stage 1: Denial (January--April 2022)
The first stage was denial. 
Despite the fact that I had a prior pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis and had been experiencing symptoms of DID my entire life, I genuinely did not think I had DID. 
Several parts of me believed that I was faking to get out of my adult responsibilities[^1], other parts thought that DID was fake as I was matching my symptoms to the disorder because I was reading so much about it [^2], and one very adamant part thought my therapist was inducing my symptoms [^3].
In fact, none of these excuses were correct, but the denial was protective---it prevented me, albeit momentarily, from the awareness that I had a disorder caused by childhood trauma, which I was not yet ready to to terms with. 
[^1]: I started "failing" at my adult responsibilities when my symptoms became worse. Instead of seeing my difficulties increasing as a result of my becoming more symptomatic, I saw it as the other way around---I believed I started faking symptoms as an excuse for my failings. I now see this as being unequivocally untrue---there is no way I could be faking these symptoms. Feelings of faking are apparently very common in early stages of treatment of DID.
[^2]: Upon learning that I likely had DID, I began reading as much as I possibly could about the disorder. Understanding DID became a "special interest" of mine, as I wanted to understand what I was apparently going through, and some parts took that as a sign I was reading about DID in order to fake it. This is also untrue.
[^3]: They definitely were not as I've had symptoms of DID since before I started therapy, but a common argument of DID deniers is that it's therapist induced, which, in my case, is not true.

During this stage, I didn't really even know that my symptoms were symptoms---they were normal to me, so I assumed everyone was experiencing what I did. I was switching between parts with full amnesia, but [amnesia is tricky, and less obvious than it sounds](/posts/amnesia/), so I genuinely didn't know I was had any amnesia. I was emotionally numb, like I normally am, and life was a blur. During this stage, I was unaware that I was affected by a dissociative disorder because I refused to see it.


#### Stage 2: Acceptance (April--August 2022)
The next stage was acceptance. 
In April, I had several strange experiences that could only be explained by me having DID. I started noticing switches between parts, and became aware that my handwriting changed depending on which part of me was active. I began to accept that I actually did have a dissociative disorder, and that the mental health professionals I was working with were correct. 
My symptoms starting becoming more obvious, with me realizing I experience full amnesia between parts by repeatedly finding evidence that I had done things that I had no memory of doing. I also began having more dissociative episodes, where traumatized parts would take over, but thankfully most of them occurred in therapy. I began experiencing rapid switching, where I switch between parts in a quick succession in response to stress. This is a disorienting experience, which typically ends in me having a headache. 

However, while my symptoms starting coming to light, I could not tell apart my parts---I was sometimes able to tell when I switched, but I wouldn't know which part I switched to or from. This was a particularly scary stage, as I started seeing the chaos but I simultaneously had no idea what exactly was going on---how was my system structured? I had no idea---I hadn't yet had time to collect enough data yet. 


#### Stage 3: Seeing my parts (August 2022--March 2023)

In the next stage, rather than simply seeing _symptoms_, I started seeing the _parts_ underlying those symptoms.  I started being able to correlate my handwriting changes with changes in other attributes, like interestes and posture. I looked back at what I remembered of my life and was able to see my being able to see how my parts had changed throughout my life. I began to learn more about my system structure, and that I was polyfragmented.

I was still internally numb with a low dynamic range of emotions, just as I always was. 

I was _seeing_ my parts---as in, I was tracking my symptoms and assigning meaning to them---but I wasn't _connected_ to them---I couldn't feel their associated emotions.
#### Stage 4: Connecting with my parts (March 2023--now)



<!--

I could only really tell when I did experience a switch, but I didn't know which part I was switching from or to. 
I even took the [DES-II](http://traumadissociation.com/des), a screening tool for dissociative disorders, and scored sub-threshold for PTSD, so there was no way I thought I could have DID. In reality, I had amnesia for my symptoms---if I take the test today, I would score within the range for DID. 

One day in April, I had my first experience of "rapid switching" where I was aware that I was switching---I had a blip in consciousness, and my handwriting would change. Then another blip, and my handwriting changed again. This switching happened several times, each part having 
as I switched between parts, giving me a massive headache and definitive evidence that I had DID.
which are much more subtle than it sounds, and essentially feels like a blip in cons

One year 3 months into 


But while I started being able to see my some of symptoms more clearly, I still could not tell apart my parts. 
they kept me from coming to terms with the fact that I was having the difficulties I did as an adult due to trauma I experienced as a child.
