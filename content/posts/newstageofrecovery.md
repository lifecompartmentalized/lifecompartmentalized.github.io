One year 3 months into 

In November of 2021, I had what I thought was a panic attack from a highly specific trigger of trauma that I experienced as a child.
I met with a psychiatrist at my school who, upon hearing of my symptoms and pediatric mental health history, likely immediately knew that I had a dissociative disorder and recommended therapy. 
They set me up with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders, who I started working with in January 2022.


Since starting therapy, I've been through many different stages of recovery. 

#### Stage 1: Denial (January--April 2022)
The first stage was denial. 
Despite the fact that I had a prior pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis and have been experiencing symptoms of DID my entire life, I genuinely did not think I had DID. 
Several parts of me believed that I was faking to get out of my adult responsibilities[^1], other parts thought that DID was fake as I was matching my symptoms to the disorder because I was reading so much about it [^2], and one very adamant part thought my therapist was inducing my symptoms [^3].
In fact, none of these excuses were correct, but they kept me from coming to terms with the fact that I was having difficulties as an adult due to trauma I experienced as a child. 
[^1]: I started "failing" at my adult responsibilities when my symptoms became worse. Instead of seeing my difficulties increasing as a result of my becoming more symptomatic, I saw it as the other way around---I believed I started faking symptoms as an excuse for my failings. I now see this as being unequivocally untrue---there is no way I could be faking these symptoms. Feelings of faking are apparently very common in early stages of treatment of DID.
[^2]: Upon learning that I likely had DID, I began reading as much as I possibly could about the disorder. Understanding DID became a "special interest" of mine, as I wanted to understand what I was apparently going through, and some parts took that as a sign I was reading about DID in order to fake it. This is also untrue.
[^3]: They definitely were not as I've had symptoms of DID since before I started therapy, but a common argument of DID deniers is that it's therapist induced, which, in my case, is not true.

During this stage, I didn't really even know that my symptoms were symptoms---they were normal to me, so I assumed everyone was experiencing what I did. I was switching between parts with full amnesia, but [amnesia is tricky, and less obvious than it sounds](/posts/amnesia/), so I genuinely didn't know I was having it. I was emotionally numb, like I normally am, and  

I even took the [DES-II](http://traumadissociation.com/des), a screening tool for dissociative disorders, and scored sub-threshold for PTSD, so there was no way I thought I could have DID. In reality, I had amnesia for my symptoms---if I take the test today, I would score within the range for DID. 

#### Stage 2: Acceptance (April--August 2022)
The next stage was acceptance. 
One day in April, I had my first experience of "rapid switching" where I was aware that I was switching---I had a blip in consciousness, and my handwriting would change. Then another blip, and my handwriting changed again. This switching happened several times, each part having 
as I switched between parts, giving me a massive headache and definitive evidence that I had DID.
I started being able to see my symptoms more clearly, and it 


#### Stage 3: Seeing my parts (August 2022--March 2023)

In the next stage, rather than seeing _symptoms_, I started seeing the _parts_ underlying those symptoms. 



#### Stage 4: Connecting with my parts (March 2023--now)
