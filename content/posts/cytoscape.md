Everybody, regardless of if they have a dissociative disorder or not, has parts to their personality. For example, one may generally behave differently at work than they do at home---they have a "work self" and a "home self". 
In someone without a dissociative disorder, 
when one transitions between their work self and their home self, they likely have a continuous internal sense of memory and identity---when they're at home, they still remember what happened while they were at work and relate to those experiences. Using graphs, we can denote the relationship between the their work self and home self with two nodes, each denoting a part of their personality, and one edge connecting the nodes, relating the shared sense of memory and identity between the two parts.

Here, in an individual without a dissociative disorder, their work self and their home self are aware of and relate to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the other part. 
But people have more than just a work self and a home self---they have a multitude of parts, representing many different facets of their personality. For simplicity's sake we will only look at 6 of these parts to represent their entire personality, but without loss of generality, this concept can be extrapolated to as many parts as needed to represent the whole personality.
In an individual without a dissociative disorder, their parts form a complete graph---all the nodes are connected with edges to all the other nodes, so all their parts remember and relate to the actions of other parts.

The similar colors of the nodes, or parts, represents the small variations in personality changes between parts of their whole personality.
Because their parts are familiar with and aware of one another, their personality changes would generally blend smoothly between their parts.

Things may be a bit different in an individual with a dissociative disorder. While they still may have similar types of parts to someone without a dissociative disorder, their graph may look something like this:

{{< cytoscape id="system1" >}}

Their parts do not form a complete graph---the lack of connection between their parts represents the lack of continuity of memory and identity between parts of self. The different colors represent that their identity variation is likely to be larger than that of a more integrated individual because their parts are more separated.

Everybody with DID is going to have a different system structure, which depends on their reactions to their life experiences.

While it isn't necessarily important for individuals without a dissociative disorder to map out their parts[^1], since their parts are aware of the 
In order to map memory, awareness, and identity differences between the parts, it is vital that someone with a dissociative disorder learns more about their parts of their personality.
