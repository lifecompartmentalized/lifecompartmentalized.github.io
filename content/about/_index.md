title: "About"
---
I am a STEM PhD student in the USA nearing the completion of my degree.
I have been in therapy for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) since January of 2022.
I am currently navigating life as a [polyfragmented](/dictionary/#polyfragmented) system with low identity-alteration, high amounts of switching, and day-to-day amnesia as I attempt to complete my degree. 
I wish to remain anonymous until I understand how revealing my identity may potentially affect my future career options.


On this site, I write about my experiences as an autistic person living with polyfragmented Dissociative Identity Disorder. 
These are my personal experiences, and I may use language or descriptions that other people living with these or similar disorders do not relate to.
Conversely, others living without similar disorders may relate to my experiences, as they're only human, after all.
I am not a medical or mental health professional; just someone with lived experience who spends a lot of time trying to understand how I operate in order to heal.
