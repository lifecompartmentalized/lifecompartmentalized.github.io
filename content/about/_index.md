title: "About"
---
I am a STEM PhD student in the USA nearing the completion of my degree.
I have been in therapy for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) since January 2022.
I am currently navigating life as a polyfragmented system with low identity alteration, high amounts of switching, and day-to-day amnesia as I attempt to complete my degree. 
I wish to remain anonymous as I'm unsure how revealing my identity may potentially affect my future career options.


On this site, I write about my experiences as an autistic person living with polyfragmented Dissociative Identity Disorder. 
These are my personal experiences, so they should not necessarily be generalized to other people living with these or similar disorders as different individuals may conceptualize their experiences differently.
I am not a medical or mental health professional; just someone with lived experience who is trying to understand how I operate in order to heal.

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or relate to my experiences, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mail@lico.blog">mail@lico.blog</a>.
