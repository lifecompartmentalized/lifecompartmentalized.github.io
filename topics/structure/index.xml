                    <description><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a dominant representation of DID in online discourse. Mostly, it seems as though people represent themselves as having a handful of well-defined parts, each with distinct names, ages, and characteristics. Perhaps because I am <a href="/posts/polyfragmented/">polyfragmented</a>, I experience something very different, and do not relate to the vast majority of the experiences that other people present themselves as having online. Last month, I posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/">the DID subreddit</a> to see if anyone related to my experiences:</p>





<div class="paige-quote">
    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone relates to my experiences, as I have not seen this representation of DID anywhere in the literature/online.</p>
<p>I have polyfragmented DID, with low identity alteration, day-to-day amnesia, and lots of switching (10-100+ times a day).</p>
<p>The last several years of my life have been a blur. However, I have been logging data about myself for the past ~2 years, and I have now accumulated enough to notice patterns. From this, it seems like my parts exhibit cyclical behavior. It seems like I have one part as my dominant part for anywhere from several hours to a few weeks. During this time, other task-based and trauma-holding parts seem to &ldquo;come out&rdquo; of that dominant part as needed. Eventually, a new dominant part takes over, and lasts a chunk of time before a different one takes over. After I have cycled through all of these dominant parts, they repeat in a similar order, with a period lasting ~3-5 months. Occasionally, new parts are added to this cycle. I have not yet gained enough internal awareness to know which &ldquo;part of the cycle&rdquo; I am in in a given moment, but if I look back at my data, it&rsquo;s clear that I have cyclical patterns across several different data points.</p>
<p>Does anyone here exhibit anything similar to this? Do you know of others that experience this system structure? Do you have any tips for the recovery process?</p>
<p>With this awareness, my life makes a whole lot more sense. I spend much of my time confused and out of date about where I am in life, as many of my parts are unaware of large aspects of my life. Because my dominant parts switch so readily, I&rsquo;m repeatedly having to re-update myself about my life circumstances (if I&rsquo;m even aware enough about my current life to do so!), and since these parts only repeat every few months, each part of me feels like they are losing large chunks of time. Life is so chaotic right now. I am in therapy 2x a week and am slowly making, and subsequently losing, progress. Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>You can view the original Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/166f8ui/polyfragmented_did_cycling_between_parts/">here</a>.
I received a lot of comments on this post, with many people relating to my experiences and sharing their own.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a very uncomfortable and unknown form of DID to have. My sense of self changes so rapidly, and internally things are very chaotic. It&rsquo;s hard to definitively describe what I&rsquo;m experiencing, as things change quickly enough that I often forget what I previously discovered. The only way I am able to confirm that this is actually what I am going through is because I have compiled enough data about myself to determine that I have clear cyclical patterns (see <a href="/posts/systemdata/">Learning about my system with data</a>).
Internally, things were too chaotic for me to discover this pattern independently, but now that I know that this is how I work I can confirm the pattern fits with my internal experiences as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reassuring to know that other people are going through similar experiences to me. At least one person said they experienced this at earlier stages of their recovery and their system is more stable now. I&rsquo;ve been in therapy for just over 1.5 years, and I believe this system pattern began in late 2019 due to the stress caused by my PhD qualifying exams. Before taking my qualifying exams, I had two main handwritings that would show up in my academic notes, and were stable for at least the previous 5 years. After my qualifying exams, which went horribly and could be considered traumatic for me, I gradually gained more and more different handwritings as more parts were being created and added to the cycle. Now, I have an uncountable number of distinct handwritings that I switch between seemingly cyclically.</p>
<p>It seems like, depending on which part of the cycle I am in, I have very different understandings of my life. I talk about this in <a href="/posts/howdidaffectswork/">How DID affects my work</a>. I can go for weeks where I am hyperfocused on work and advancing in my research, followed by weeks where I am mostly unaware that I am even a graduate student who is supposed to be working. I am trying hard to break this cycle, but it seems to be going strong. There have been several occasions where I believed I was able to stop my cycle (for example, see <a href="/posts/wakingup/">Waking up to the present</a>), but I always end up losing my awareness and advancing in the cycle. I hope someday soon my system will stabilize more so I can live the life I want to live and remain grounded to the reality of the present.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Life is moving very rapidly right now. I wrote the previous post (<a href="/posts/wakingup/">Waking up to the present</a>) six weeks ago, shortly after I had split a new cluster of parts. Then, three weeks ago, I split a whole new cluster of parts. Both six weeks ago and three weeks ago I had very distinct changes in my behavioral patterns and how I operate. I have two very distinct &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; in my continuity of memory both three and six weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have been creating new clusters of parts due to stressors for my whole life, but up until recently I wasn&rsquo;t aware I was doing it&mdash;it was &ldquo;normal&rdquo; to me, so I didn&rsquo;t know anything was off. Until I learned that I had DID, I didn&rsquo;t have a framework from which to understand my experiences. Since starting therapy for DID, I have become much more aware of my internal states and, with lots of practice and observation, I am now generally able to tell when I have switched between or created new compartments of memory.</p>
<p>While cultivating my internal qualitative awareness of my system is important, I am a very quantitative-minded person&mdash;I want hard, solid evidence that what I am going through is actually happening. And now I finally do.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started tracking information about my life and logging it in a database. I started small, tracking simple things like medications taken, my weight, and when I showered. Over time, I started tracking more and more complex things as I became more aware of patterns in my life. For example, there are times when I have a distinctly different gait than normal, and other times where I chew my tongue habitually in a distinct way, along with many other factors. I also automatically log certain things such as the activity on my computer and phone, along with steps taken and when I fall asleep/wake up every day. I generally log the activities of what I do in a day, in broad categories such as work, eating, and walking, over time.
I now have tens of thousands of data points about myself, spread over a few years, from which I can draw conclusions off of.
I also journal every day, in both a personal journal and a work journal, so I also have a lot of free-form data along with handwriting from that.</p>
<p>Now, looking at my data, across multiple factors, I see distinct changes in how I operate both three and six weeks ago. Internally, I already knew this, but having physical data to back up my internal awareness definitely validates my understanding of my system.
In addition to providing solid quantitative evidence of my system, logging data about myself requires me to be observant and mindful of my life&rsquo;s activities, which in turn helps me to gain internal awareness of how I operate.</p>
<p>In a way, I am collecting data about myself to solve an inverse problem. Given the data that I acquire about myself, can I determine the underlying model about how I operate? With time, as I acquire more data, its becoming increasingly more clear. I am figuring out how I operate, slowly but surely, using the best way I know how&mdash;using data.</p>
<p>I feel I am in a different stage of recovery now than I was even a few months ago. I have become much more aware about who I am and how I operate. I am an amalgamation of hundreds of parts who are working together, with varying levels of cooperation, to live life. As life goes on and the data I collect about myself along with my awareness grows, my confidence about the way that I operate increases. I can now definitively say that I am a polyfragmented system operating with hundreds of parts, many of which are fragments. I split parts regularly, and switch between my parts a handful to hundreds of times a day. I have different scales of parts&mdash;while I have parts that I switch between every day, I also have longer-scale parts that I shift between on the order of days to weeks. My longer-scale parts seem to be roughly cyclical, and seem to repeat on the order of a few months, seemingly dependent on life stressors. On the other hand, my daily parts seem to come out much more consistently due to more concrete triggers, such as task-based reasons or reminders of trauma.</p>
<p>Since capturing long-scale variations in data is much simpler than capturing short-scale variations in data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I am currently more focused on capturing my long-scale parts. With time and increased awareness, I hope to be able to acquire more data about my parts that switch more frequently.
But with the data I have now, I have made a few observations.
Depending on which &ldquo;part of the cycle&rdquo; I am in (in other words, which long-scale part is out), the way I operate in life is distinctly different. This includes things like my bedtime and morning routine, how well I cook and the foods I eat, my hobbies and interests, how aware of/productive I am at work, how often I shower, how long/frequently I walk, my handwriting, my gait, how often I socialize/interact with others, the video games I play and how often I play them, how interested I am in/how frequently I use marijuana, how much I am aware of/interested in my pets and plants, my awareness of my past and my future, how clean my apartment is, how aware I am of my appearance, how connected I am with my body/how sensitive I am to pain, my outlook on life, my entire internal experience, and many other things that are too personal to list here.
While for a long time I was suspicious that this was my system structure and the way that I operate, I now have sufficient enough data for me to be convinced that my model is correct.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a perfectionist. For most of my life, I thought that was a good thing. However, I now see how much it has negatively impacted my life. In this post, I explore my understanding one aspect of that&mdash;I believe that the combination of my perfectionistic tendencies plus my capacity to dissociate to a high degree is a main cause of my difficulties in the present.</p>
<p>Growing up, I strived to be the &ldquo;perfect child&rdquo;&mdash;I made good grades, never got into trouble, and was always submissive, smiling, and pleasant to be around. I made life incredibly easy for my parents and everyone else around me.
Of course, I had my difficult moments, but for the most part, my main goal in life was to embody perfection in every way possible.
And I believed that I succeeded.
However, while most parts of me strived for and held a perfect view of myself, not all parts of me met expectations.
In order to maintain my internal perception that I was perfect, I used dissociation to disown the parts of self and experiences that didn&rsquo;t fit my perfect view of self. Because I have DID, I learned the ability to subconsciously compartmentalize and disown any actions and experiences that are ego-dystonic, thus allowing me to curate my view of my self and the world around me.
In order to maintain this perfect self-view, I relied on maintaining dissociative barriers between parts of self&mdash;the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; parts of me disowned the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; parts of me, resulting in amnesia for times where I didn&rsquo;t meet my own inflated expectations.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was able to hold this perfectionist view of my life while still remaining functional. Although while in high school I had some academic difficulties, I found college to be pretty easy, primarily due to the fact that I had no life outside of school and academics. I strived to only earn As, and was successful, for the most part, because of how much energy I put into my studies. Overall, I had a pretty solid understanding and memory of my life during my undergraduate years, and showed effectively no negative symptoms of DID.</p>
<p>During grad school, things became more difficult. I was surrounded by peers who were more hard-working and intelligent than I was. I was taking classes that were more difficult than I was used to, along with doing research that I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had enough time or energy for. I struggled with the transition from undergrad to grad school, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it. My automatic response of disowning difficult experiences took over, resulting in me truly only seeing the &ldquo;good&rdquo; aspects of life. My worldview was so skewed towards the positive that I didn&rsquo;t see myself slipping more and more behind as my degree progressed. Parts of me held onto the perfectionistic view of self and life, while other parts of me were struggling with the reality of grad school, and neither parts were fully aware of the other parts. In grad school, my parts became more separated from each other than they had ever been before because I was not able to maintain the perfect view of myself, resulting in amnesia for large chunks of my grad school experience.</p>
<p>Over time, I went from functioning well at a high level to being effectively unaware of large aspects of my life and the world around me. I was not meeting my own expectations, and instead of allowing myself to realize that, I automatically turned to dissociation to make myself unaware of my perceived failings. While in reality, I was just encountering the stress that almost every graduate student faces, it was enough to trigger my dissociative defenses. However, I cannot emphasize enough that, for the vast majority of the time, I was simply unaware that I even had any stress or troubles because I had amnesia for those experiences. Thus, until starting therapy, I genuinely thought I was doing well in graduate school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only within the past year that I realized anything abnormal was happening. Last June, at the recommendation of others with DID, I started a journal to process my thoughts about my life. When I would read my journal back, I realized that there were entries in my journal that I didn&rsquo;t remember writing, in handwritings that I didn&rsquo;t recognize as my own. I&rsquo;d read these entries and see that they had a very different perspective of my life than I did. Over time, it became clear that I had separation between parts who were aware of my life&rsquo;s difficulties and those who were not. I had split parts to allow me to maintain my perfectionistic and positive world view.</p>
<p>Now, about 1.5 years after starting therapy, my amnesia surrounding negative life experiences has significantly improved. I now recognize my multiple handwritings and am mostly able to tell when parts who hold negative emotions, memories, and views of life are active. However, once more positive-viewing parts are out, I still have trouble relating to those negative emotions and experiences. I still generally have a positive view of life and self the vast majority of the time, but I&rsquo;m now also aware of the negative aspects of myself and life as well.</p>
<p>Having DID allowed to me believe that I truly <em>was</em> perfect. Not because I actually was&mdash;because nobody is&mdash;but because I would disown parts of self and experiences that didn&rsquo;t fit my perfectionistic view of myself, resulting in amnesia and an incomplete view of my life and circumstances. Because I strove for perfection over all else, I was able to mostly meet my perfectionsitic standards through high school and college&mdash;not much happened in my life then that fell outside of my range of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. In graduate school, however, I fell far behind because I wasn&rsquo;t able to meet my own expectations. I&rsquo;d then disown those experiences, leading to amnesia for large chunks of my life. When things got hard, I automatically relied on maladaptive coping mechanisms instead of fixing the problem at its root, resulting in more and more problems piling up. However, now that I am in touch with both the negative and positive aspects of life, I&rsquo;m more aware of my life circumstances and am functioning much better. I still have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m making progress to becoming a more integrated person every day. One of the most important lessons I&rsquo;ve learned thus far is that I am not perfect, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Pretty early on in my DID discovery journey, I realized that my handwriting was different depending on which part of me was writing. This was very useful information, as I had taken well-catalogued academic notes for years prior to starting therapy, so I had a solid bank of data of which I could look back on and see which parts of me were active at different times of my life.</p>
<p>One thing I quickly noticed was that any time I traveled to a conference, my handwriting changed. And then when I got back, my handwriting changed back to whatever was normal at that time of my life<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
Internally, this also made sense&mdash;I tend to index my life by location rather than time. In fact, in all of my notebooks' index sections, I had added a column for location, in addition to the standard page number and date. My mind likes segmenting my life based on location.</p>
<p>Why could this be the case? Why do I create parts when I travel? Looking back at my life story, it actually makes a lot of sense.
My first several years of life involved a lot of traveling. Although I was born in the US, when I was just over 2 months old, my family moved to the Middle East for my dad&rsquo;s job.
As a perk of being an expat, my dad&rsquo;s job paid for two vacations a year&mdash;one for rest and relaxation, and another to visit family.
Because of this, by my 5th birthday, I had been to 11 different countries between 4 continents, all on separate trips.</p>
<p>This sounds like an incredibly fortunate childhood, and while it was, it was also very stressful for me.
As an autistic person, I regulate myself by following a strict routine. As an adult, changes in plans are very dysregulating, and usually leave me in a detached dissociated state with difficulty picking up the newly created plans.
I can only imagine how dysregulating it was for me as a small child to have my routine entirely upended every several months to travel to a new environment with an unknown routine.
I had no option&mdash;my family chose to travel, and since within my family structure the emotional landscape was already dominated by others, I had to be an easy child and submit to whatever they wanted. This led to me dissociating and creating parts to handle the traveling for me.</p>
<p>This past summer, I went to my first conference while aware that I create parts this way.
The night leading up to the event, I remember absolutely dreading the trip, wishing I could back out but knowing that I couldn&rsquo;t. Then, when the time came, I genuinely enjoyed the conference&mdash;the right part showed up for the job. I did seem to create a part for this trip, and this was the first part that I was self-aware I was creating. I had no control over it; instead, I observed its creation as I walked into the hotel lobby to check in. A new persona emerged, and was ready to take on whatever routine was required of me for my week-long conference that was just getting started. With that part as the dominant part, other parts came out periodically to do what was required of me, like networking, socializing, and presenting. But this newly created part was the star of the show, helping me create a solid routine I could stick to throughout the week to help keep me regulated. Then, on the last day, once again the dread came&mdash;this time, I, as the newly created part, didn&rsquo;t want to change my routine back again as I was only familiar with the one I had created. However, when I arrived in my apartment after a long journey back, a different part switched in and I was so glad to be home and back again in my standard routine.</p>
<p>We traveled to many beautiful locations in my early childhood, and I truly appreciate all the culturally enriching experiences I acquired, which I believe to this day have helped shaped my worldview. I do, however, wish that my parents were more aware of how stressful this was for me as a child. I did not understand the significance of the locations we would visit, and felt as though I was being dragged from place to place without understanding what was going on around me. In pictures of our family vacations, it&rsquo;s clear that I am dissociating&mdash;many of them show me with a blank expression with my eyes glazed over. I learned to regulate myself by dissociating, detaching from the world around me. And these repeated experiences of traveling = part creation have continued throughout my life, increasingly fragmenting my awareness when I take trips.</p>
<p>I believe this is a good example of how trauma, but not necessarily abuse, can lead to the formation of DID.
I would not consider traveling as much as we did abuse, but it was traumatic because it was too much for me to handle at the developmental stages it occurred in.
One could argue that this was neglect or negligence&mdash;that my parents weren&rsquo;t attuned to my emotional needs at the time.
However, it does not fit into the category of extreme abuse that is often attributed to the creation of DID.
While I do not believe this was the only trauma that caused me to form DID, and some of those traumas would be considered abuse,
traveling in the way that we did when I was small had a major impact on how I create parts, and is perhaps the most influential mechanism of part creation in my adult life.</p>
