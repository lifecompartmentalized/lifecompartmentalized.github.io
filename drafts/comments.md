# Amnesia

, so the scariest thing might be I find myself hiding under the blanets of my bed when I thought I was in my kitchen.

How does one know if the way they experience the world is _normal_? It never even occurred to me that aspects my experience could be considered disordered until recently. Now that I'm aware, so much of my life makes sense. 

The way I experience amnesia seems to be more nuanced than what I have described here thus far, but I haven't formulated the words to fully describe these experiences yet.


These experiences can be explained by me switching between compartments of memory that I haven't been in in a while, and occur on an a weekly to daily basis for me.

Another type of amnesia that some people with dissociative disorders report[^3] is emotional amnesia, where they remember the events of what happened when they're in a different compartment, but don't have the associated emotions attached with that memory. I believe I experience this too, but because of the structure of my DID, I believe almost all of my memories do not have associated emotions attached to them[^6]. This seems to be my normal memory, so for me 
the distinction between experiencing emotional amnesia or having a "normal" memory isn't clear. I don't believe I often experience strong emotions[^4], though, so I'm not sure if I'm experiencing some sort of amnesia or if I just don't have the associated emotions to encode in my memories. 
[^4]: I don't remember what I don't remember, so maybe I do experience strong emotions more than I think; I'm honestly not sure.
[^3]: I learned about this from r/DID and r/OSDD on Reddit
[^6]: Also, most, if not all, of my memories seem to be in third person, even if they aren't trauma related. This may be why I don't have the first-person perspective of emotion attached to them.


In fact, one way I can differentiate between my parts is by 

it isn't clear if I could be experiencing something different.

so out of context for a part of me that cleans because it seems like a different section of my life.

I personally see myself as having three types of amnesia.

This memory will not be clear, and often has a "not me" feeling associated with it---it can feel like I'm indexing someone else's memories

I'm used to living with a constricted internal awareness that realizing I have amensia isn't surprising to me much anymore---it seems to be a normal part of my 

I'm only aware I'm in a different compartment when looking back in time. In the moment-to-moment, I always feel like _me_. That is; my sense of "I" does not change. This is why I like to conceptualize my experience as me switching between different compartments rather than 

Now that I know what switching feels like, I realize that I have day-to-day amnesia. 

When I look backat the 

I also often have the experience of 
Memory is tricky. When I think about my life, I am unaware I have amnesia

My whole life, I've had experiences where people claimed I had done things I had absolutely no memory of doing. These things seemed like things I would absolutely never do, and to be honest, I never thought too much about it.

In high school, I saw the same group of friends in class that I did outside of school. I clearly had different parts 

So now, looking back, of course I had amnesia. However, it's a lot more hidden than one would expect, because I simply do not remember what I do not remember. It's only when I have external sources notifying me that something happened that I didn't remember do I realize I must have had amnesia. 

It's honestly really scary know that I could potentially forget what I am doing right now in the future. How much of my life will I remember? Are these memories I'm making in my life encoding properly? I sure hope so---I don't want gaps in my memory.

With that being said, because I truly don't know what I don't know, I'm often not aware I'm missing anything.

My justification for these events was always that the other person was lying,

Is it amnesia proper, or is it just my awareness is so shuffled since I switch between many different compartments of memory in a day? 

At the end of the day, when my partner and I ask each other how our days were, I can typically give him a general impression of how the day went---I remember the major events 



One of the hardest parts of my DID discovery journey is coming to terms that I did, in fact, do those things. I had dissociated---putting me in a different compartment of awareness with a different mindset.

Who I thought I was is not who I actually was. Some parts 

I have difficulties tracking the passage of time. 
When I wake up in the morning, I have to orient myself to what day it 
Because I have so many different parts with varying levels of memory sharing between them, there are times where I won't know what I'm doing moment-to-moment.
the way I encoded and accessed memories was different from most others

In this case, it's not that I don't remember what happened when I was in a different compartment. 


# Anger



## THIS POST NEEDS TO BE REWORKED
But I now realize that the absence of anger in my life is significant in itself, and is indicative of how my underlying dissociative defense system operates.
Anger is an emotion I learned to dissociate away from a very young age. 

---it can be the driving force required to get one out of bad situations


Because of this, I learned to associate anger with terror and instability, and internally decided that anger was an emotion I did not want to experience.






I do not believe I have ever experienced anger before.

 Like anxiety, anger is an emotion I have dissociated away. However, unlike anxiety, which I do experience, I do not believe I have ever experienced true anger before.


Anger is an emotion I am not acquainted with. 

My mom tells me she's only seen me angry twice in my life---both involved her doing things to my cat without getting permission. In these cases, I'm sure I was acting to protect my cat, but I do not fully remember either incident. It would be too destabilizing for me to realize that 

I have been trained to be very sensitive to the signs of anger in others---


I am very familiar with anger as expressed by others. 



My understanding of anger comes from a theoretical view---I can intellectually understand it, but I do not believe I have ever felt anger before. 

I have a rudimentary understanding of anger. 


I understand why anger is important
It can be the driving force one needs to fight against harm or injustice done to them.

Anger is a powerful emotion. It can help one to enact change in their life,

I am very unfamiliar with anger

I do not believe I have ever felt anger before. I believe this is common 
It may be hypocritical for me to write a post on an emotion that I am so unfamiliar with. 


My dynamic range of emotions is very shallow---most of the time, I feel mild contentment. 
I grew up in an environment where I didn't feel like I could take up any emotional space, as the emotional landscape in my family of origin was dominated by others' strong emotional displays. 

I enjoy my internal stability---I do not want to feel strong emotions. I am scared of the loss of control I was so used to seeing while growing up. 

those around me dominated the emotional landscape. 
I do not have much experience with strong emotions, 


I have never experienced strong emotions


# Anxiety


I have a very curated internal experience---emotionally, I feel 

The irrational thought loops 
At least not in a normal way anymore. 

DID shapes the way I experience emotions.

Different aspects of my life are compartmentalized 

When I was a child, I was filled with worry. 



# Fluctuating intelligence



, but now that I'm aware of the problem, I see the path forward in how to improve.

Becoming aware that I have DID has offered a much-needed explanation for why my brain works in this way. 

## THIS POST NEEDS TO BE REWORKED
talk more about the disconnect between feeling smart vs not smart. pompous part too.

The divide between aspects of life that are hard to hold together. fault lines between parts of self.


In a PhD program[^1], other than one's thesis defense that is the capstone of their degree, the qualifying exam is the most important test of one's degree. The qualifying exam typically occurs a year or two into the degree, and is meant to assess if one is qualified to continue in the PhD program. What exactly a qualifying exam consists of differs from school to school, and department to department. In my program, my qualifying exam was a "chalk talk"---you choose three topics of concentration, and three experts on those fields will ask you questions which you answer on the chalk board. They assess your responses and determine if you're qualified to continue in the degree.

[^1]: Ones I am familiar with in the USA.


In high school. I wasn't aware I had DID. But looking back with the awareness I now have, there are many instances of fluctuating intelligence that can be perfectly explained by having DID. My freshman year, I had a turbulent home environment


For example, in high school, there were times where I'd teach my friends material that would be on the exam, and then I'd do poorly on the exam while they would do well.

My qualifying exam


I do not have access to my full set of knowledge and skills, and 
When this part of me is active

I can feel the intelligence differential between myself and others around me. Over time, when I was in that compartment 



There are some things in life that just made so much more sense after I realized I had DID. Probably the most frustrating one was my fluctuating intelligence. This explained how I could teach my friends the material for a math exam and subsequently fail it while my friends did well. 

I have a complicated relationship with academics.
As a PhD student, 

One of the most frustrating symptoms that falls under the category of _symptoms I've had my entire life but didn't realize_ is flucutating intelligence.

This is, perhaps, one of the most frustrating parts of having DID.

# Finding my language


How do I find the vocabulary to describe experiences that are can be either so mundane or extraordinary?
grow more comfortable with the language that feels most authentic to me. 

it made myself and others uncomfortable. 

On this blog, I have decided to use whatever language is most appropriate for describing the particular experiences that I'm trying to convey---I don't want to limit myself to a particular conceptualization or vocabulary set. So while I have mostly written from the perspective of a unified self thus far, I hope to write with more diverse views in the future.

In order to have a more accurate view of my life, I need to look at things from the perspectives of my individual parts. 


Looking at things from the perspectives of my individual parts,
While I have learned to internally reference myself being a system of multiple parts of self, I am hesitant to externally display this perspective with others. 

With time, I have begun to realize that I have two main ways of conceptualizing how I operate---I experience both the perspective of me as a whole person, as well as the perspectives of me as my individual parts. The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm. While this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with this view.

I never have a complete view of my life unless I take a step back and realize that there are things I may not be aware of at any given moment.
I may write from the prospective of my parts, or me as a whole, or a combination of both. 

Or how you perceive the world around you

I may strongly believe that an individual is an amazing person and a good friend, only to later see the red flags of my relationship with that person 

Have you thought about the language you use to describe your internal experience? I personally hadn't given it much thought until I learned I had DID. 
How one chooses to conceptualize their experiences is deeply personal, both for those with and without a dissociative disorder.

so my perspective as a whole person is influenced by which compartment I am currently in.
 since I only have the perspective of the part I currently am
---each part of me has its own perspective, which may clash with my whole-self view 
How does one convey their internal conflict, switching and influence of parts, 

But this leaves me in a tough spot---how do I to convey my experiences that are different than the norm while still trying to stay within the language 
hesitant to portray myself differently from 

To me, most of these conceptualizations of DID seem 
I view these conceptualizations as metaphors to describe ones internal experiences. 
With DID, different people conceptualize their internal experiences
I have a deeply divided, messy 
my parts have a complex internal relationships. What do I convey this to others?

For me, it is often difficult to put into words the experiences I've been though because of DID. 


While using only this view this may work for most people, solely looking at myself this way causes me to miss out of various aspects of life since my internal experiences don't fully align with having a unified perspective.

# Not about identity


For a long time, I was adament that I did not experience identity alteration. I'm now realizing that while I do have many compartments that all seem to identify as "me", some compartments are so far removed from present time and context that, when I am in them, I do not perceive myself as being the adult me I actually am. 
I now see my initial attempts to deny my identity alteration as a way of denying that I do, in fact, have DID, and once again used my coping mechanisms to shove that knowledge out of my awareness. This is because coming to terms with having DID means coming to terms with having childhood trauma, and while that was once too hard for me to accept, I am beginning to accept it now.



Denial is a major part of this disorder, and one year and two months into therapy, I'm still coming to terms with the fact that I utilized this effective coping strategy in response to childhood trauma, which is known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. d
Denial is a major part of this disorder, and one year and two months into therapy, I'm still coming to terms with this.

So DID is really not about identity---it's about childhood trauma and the extreme compartmentalization that may form because of it. 
This only scratches the surface of what I experience as a results of having DID.
There are many occasions that I have been shocked to hear how I behaved when more vulnerable parts of my personality have been out,.

For example, I have parts that clean for me, because at one time I likely decided that although I really didn't want to clean, I needed to, so I created a part to do so for me. 

While this was an incredibly effective coping strategy for me when I was actively experiencing trauma, it 

This has been an incredibly effective strategy in emotional regulation for me. In fact, my dynamic range of emotions is so low, that my main emotional state exists solely of mild contentment, which I seemingly experience most of the time.



On this blog, I hope to document my experiences as a system of memory compartments, which I like to call parts, working together in the relay race of life in an attempt to live it to the fullest.



Because this compartment creation strategy has been my primary coping mechanism, as time went on, I created more and more compartments as a response to small life stressors, which has been unsustainable. 
 an unsustainable 

Detaching from the world around me allowed me to regulate how much of my surroundings I experienced, which has been particularly helpful as an autistic person with sound and light sensitivities.
Over time, rather than the standard development of a fluid personality with a singular sense of "me", I developed several discretely separated personality states that I need to switch between to experience life.

Because of the internal compartmentalization, the parts of me who lived a normal childhood did not remember the events that occurred to the parts of me who experienced trauma. This allowed my compartments that experienced life to grow and thrive as a child, while my other compartments held the hurt and pain of the abuse. 
This led to 

While many individuals with this disorder may only experience a split in traumatized vs untraumatized parts of their personality, 

As I became older and was no longer actively encountering abuse, because it was so deeply engrained in how I operate, I still used this part creation strategy to aid in every day life.

Detaching from the world around me was a way I learned to regulate myself. For example, because I am autistic, I have sound and light sensitivities. 

, which has been particularly helpful as an autistic person with sound and light sensitivities.

This became a highly effective strategy---I learned to dedicate parts of me to handling abuse, and other parts of me to learning and growing as a child. 
---I was oblivious to the fact that this abuse caused me to form a severe mental disorder that would impact me for the rest of my life.

Because this abuse occurred at a time in which my brain was rapidly developing, this strategy of detachment and compartmentalization became engrained as an effective

Yet, perhaps because of the name, or the media representation, 

When I started therapy almost 14 months ago, I genuinely believed that dissociative identity disorder (DID) was a fake disorder that people feigned to get out of trouble or for attention. My understanding of DID was influenced by the social and traditional media representation of the disorder, which generally portrayed people experiencing drastic personality shifts, or seemingly role-playing characters. I never thought this disorder could apply to me---for the most part, I was soft spoken, reclusive, and tried my hardest to blend into society. However, as I know now, I am a typical, but not stereotypical, example of how DID presents.

DID is caused by repetitive trauma in early childhood, while the brain is rapidly developing. To put it simply, one way a child can cope with trauma

# The parts I don't know about still have control


It's not that I as a whole am not experiencing this fear; rather I simply am not connected with it. 


_Yeah, sure. You're chasing and yelling at me. Clearly there's something to be scared about_.
---my months long routine of going on an eveng walk ended, and I genuinely didn't even notice. I felt no fear associated with walking, but my behavior was controlled by the fear of that event occurring again, held by a part of me who wasn't connected with the core me.

About a month into stopping, I suddenly realized that I hadn't gone on a walk in a long time.
However, beyond my awareness, a part was terrified.  

 being mindful of my surroundings. I forced myself to walk past the location of the event again, trying to disassociate it with fear. 

I feel as though this is a classic example for how I ---my deepest emotions and fears, that I am not even aware of, can show up on my face for others to see without me even realizing it. 
One of the ways I experience DID is that the parts of me who hold onto traumatic memories and emotions are separated from the parts of me who 

# Polyfragmented


My internal awareness of my life is also shuffled, so I may have a hard time differentiating what happened yesterday versus what happened last week or last month, or struggle with remembering if, for example, a cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday.
It can feel like every day a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I left off yesterday. 

I'm only at the beginning of my journey to discovering how I operate, and I'm learning more about my system every day. 

At the very begining of my journey to discovering how I operate, I never could have imagined that I had this chaotic of a system. 

I am not a singular part, with other parts being "other" to me, which is how some people seem to conceptualize having DID.
Rather, I am all of my parts, and all of my parts are me. These parts seem to represent pieces of the whole me. My life is fragmented into many different compartments that I switch between. Depending on which compartment I am in, I will have a different internal experience. For the most part, externally, there is not much differentiation between my parts. You will likely not be able to tell when one part is out vs a different part is out.



Many of my parts share memory and are cooperative with one another.
Right now, as I write this, 
up until recently, I was just as dysfunctional, but I didn't know I was because I didn't know I had DID and daily amnesia. Now that I am much more aware of what is going on in my life, I have full confidence that I will become more functional again soon. I have been very functional living with this disorder in the recent past, so I have full faith I'll get there again, this time with much more awareness of how I operate.






I seem to use parts differently than the most-shared representations of DID portray. Because of this, it took me an incredibly long time to see in myself that I had DID. 






I'd like to note that while I use the word "dysfunctional" to describe myself, I'm actually very high-functioning in most areas of my life. 
I use the word dysfunctional to describe the fact that this disorder is impacting my day-to-day functioning, making it hard to do the things I want to do. This is because my internal awareness is so fragmented that I do not have continuity of memory, and I have clusters of parts with different interests trying to live life in different ways, causing internal division. However, in many aspects of life, I am living functionally.



I'm using my dissociative coping mecahanisms to protect me from what could be objectively considered a difficult time, just as I have in the past. For the most part, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview. Dissociation is an amazing coping mechanism. 


For what it's worth, the labels I use to describe how I function make it seem like my life is a lot worse than it actually is. Despite the internal chaos and amnesia, I, for the most part, enjoy how I operate. I realize 

Thus, when I am triggered in the present day, I have to switch between a series of parts in rapid succession before switching back to an untraumatized part.
I am also able to take care of myself well, but 


This is the most descriptive word I've found used in the literature and online communities that represents how I experience having DID.
Most of my parts share memory between them, so switching/shifting can almost be undetectable to me. However, I do experience amnesia between some parts that come out nearly daily.
I seem to split parts easily and in a complex manner. 

With these splitting patterns, this means I have a lot of parts.

When I was young, I likely would not qualify as polyframented---my rate of part creation has increased as I aged 

I seem to have parts created to do jobs for me. For example, I have a few different parts dedicated to cleaning, a part for brushing my showering, and even a sequence of parts dedicated to getting me from putting my VR headset on to in my VR game as quickly/without my awareness as possible. My definition of what constitutes part creation is so low that a game loading screen made me create parts.

This is not a word I've seen in the academic literature, although Richard Kluft seems to describe similar phenomena in one of his papers[^1], so it's not concretely defined. To me, the word polyfragmented means a person who has many parts and/or splits them in a complex fashion. I believe I fall under the category of both. 
Because my understanding of DID was that of a more traditional presentation, I initially did not believe I had this disorder, despite having clear cases of amnesia. However, over time, I found that my presentation was simply different to the traditional presentation. It seems as though I 


rather than having a relatively few number of well-defined parts, 


Reading about experiences of people who self-identify as polyfragmented helped me to see that this label makes the most sense to me.

Because I switch so much, my relationship with time 

Rather than a few clearly defined parts, it seems as though my entire personality is split into multiple parts

My internal experience is extremely compartmentalized. When my symptoms are bad, I'm often living day-to-day, or even moment-to-moment, unaware of what I had previously been doing or what my next plans are. I feel like I'm in a state of survival---I just need to get through this moment onto the next day. This was a mindset I used as a child when I had to get through my current situation, but trusted there were good times ahead. I'd do whatever I could to pass time, to distract myself of the present moment so once the good times came, I could 

When times are good, 

However, in my adult life, this is a 
When I began graduate school, everything was stressful, and I was nearly constantly in this living moment-to-moment mindset, unable to take a step back and examine that 


I relied upon as a child to get me through times that were extremely stressful---I perceived the present moment as being bad, but I had faith that in the future. I used this when I had to get through a situation that took a long time

---the present moment is bad, but maybe the future will be better. I just need to get through this present moment to getas long as I could make it through the present moment, maybe the next. 

It took me several months of therapy with a dissociative disorders specialist in order for me to even consider that I had DID, despite having a pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis. Like many others would in my generation, as soon as I realized I was being assessed for DID, I immediately went to sites like Reddit and YouTube to see how other people with this disorder conceptualize their experiences. Needless to say, I did not relate to others' experiences that I found online. Most people I had encountered seemed to have a relatively small number clearly defined parts with clear roles. I genuinely did not believe that I had DID, despite the fact that I was frequently dissociating in therapy sessions without realizing I was doing so. 

Why do I have so many parts? The threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals---things that would be considered traumatic to me may not have affected another child as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, along with the fact that I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there's a high correlation of those who are polyfragmented and have autism.

What does this mean? It is my understanding that typically, individuals with DID split a few to several well defined parts---they don't have too many different compartments they switch between.


used colloquially to mean a system with many parts, typically with complex splitting patterns. 

I do not seem to experience this. Instead, 

I've also learned that I have many different types of parts and mechanisms for part creation.
I have many task-based parts, or parts that serve a specific job in my life, which leads to me needing to shift or switch[^6] between parts on a very regular basis.
Additionally, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to create many parts in a sequential manner, which leads to a lot of parts being created for a single event. 
I also do not only split parts due to trauma---I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged[^7]. 

# Stages of recovery


It seems that no matter which stage of my recovery journey I'm in, I feel like I have more insight than I likely actually have. It's only upon looking back at my journey do I realize how little I knew before, and how much more I know now. I'm sure I'll look back at this post in the future and see how little insight I truly have now, and that's okay. 

I could only really tell when I did experience a switch, but I didn't know which part I was switching from or to. 
I even took the [DES-II](http://traumadissociation.com/des), a screening tool for dissociative disorders, and scored sub-threshold for PTSD, so there was no way I thought I could have DID. In reality, I had amnesia for my symptoms---if I take the test today, I would score within the range for DID. 

One day in April, I had my first experience of "rapid switching" where I was aware that I was switching---I had a blip in consciousness, and my handwriting would change. Then another blip, and my handwriting changed again. This switching happened several times, each part having 
as I switched between parts, giving me a massive headache and definitive evidence that I had DID.
which are much more subtle than it sounds, and essentially feels like a blip in cons

One year 3 months into 


But while I started being able to see my some of symptoms more clearly, I still could not tell apart my parts. 
they kept me from coming to terms with the fact that I was having the difficulties I did as an adult due to trauma I experienced as a child. 

I've experienced what I label as depersonalization since I was very small. At age 4, my mom documents me telling her that I felt like a doll, that I didn't feel real. Throughout my life, the severity of my depersonalization has fluctuated significantly.

[^4]: To me, depersonalization feels like I do not feel real---I feel floaty in my body, and, as a 4 year old me described it, "I feel like a doll". That is, I feel fake and unreal. 

# Traveling

One part of me is very grateful that I had traveled so much in my childhood because that meant that I had already seen everything I would ever to in life and would never have to travel again. That part of me sees vacations a check box to complete, rather than an experience to enjoy. This line of thinking was influenced by the stress I

One could argue that this was neglect, not abuse.


With that being said, in my adult life at least, I do enjoy vacations---I'd create a part to enjoy them for me as the me that deals with every day life does not like interruptions.

As a polyfragmented system, I seem to split parts
Early into my discovery journey, something puzzled me. I learned pretty quicky 

My first several years of life were very chaotic. Although I was born in the US, when I was just over 2 months old, my family moved to the Middle East for my dad's job. 
For my whole life up to that point, while my handwriting was floridly changing, I never had questioned it or honestly really noticed it. Now, I am very thankful that I have a solid visual indicator for which parts of me were active at different times of my life.

# shuffled awareness

In undergrad, I had two main handwritings, but in grad school my handwriting has become much more inconsistent. Furthermore, because of the way I've split work parts, I can see in my academic journal that, over the span of several months, I'm writing the same things down over and over again, all in different handwritings. I'm trying really 

These experiences are just subtle enough for me to question if they are actually significant, or if everyone experiences them and I'm just hyperaware of my internal experience. It's taken me a while, but now that I know how DID affects me, I do believe that these experiences are significant, as they do impact my day-to-day functioning.


When I wake up in the morning, I never know which part of me will be active---it seems to be different most days, so I wake up almost every morning with a different internal sense of how to operate in the world. Throughout the day, as other parts come out, my priorities and interests are shifted elsewhere, directed by what the current part wants to be doing. Externally observing my behavior, when I'm alone I discretely switch from task to task in a somewhat chaotic manner.
Because I only have the awareness of the current part, this jumpy behavior feels natural to me as I follow my switches.


cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday. 

My plants in my home don't seem to grow---to me, it appears like they abruptly jump in size. 


I now have way more parts than jobs. For example, I went from having two main work parts in my undergraduate years to an uncountable number of work parts in graduate school[^1], making 
[^1] I can see this by looking at my handwriting

When I switch, it can feel like a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I just left off. Because I do not have much differentiation between my parts[^3], I often don't realize I've switched---I may just abruptly do something different to what I've previously been doing without awareness that I should be doing something else. For example, I may be working and switch to a part with no awareness of work, so I'll go do something else while that part is out and it's only when I switch to a part with awareness of work do I realize I wasn't working when I should have been. 
[^3]: I'm actively working on learning how to internally differentiate between my parts so I can sort this mess out.


I have an extremely constricted, compartmentalized awareness so that at any given time, I only have a partial understanding of my entire life, and my ability to track time between parts varies. 


It seems like I only have a full sense of time surrounding the compartment I currently am in, and when I switch between compartments it can feel like time restarts[^1].
[^1]: This seems to depend on how much the parts are familiar with each other. Some switches, which I like to call shifts, feel nearly seamless, while others, between parts who have more amnesia for each other, can feel more jarring.

For most of my life, having such a constricted awareness has been useful.
For example, as a child, this allowed me to have a compartment for when I was in an abusive situation, and a different compartment for when I was at school. Separating these experiences was beneficial---it made it so that when I was at school I had no awareness of my abusive environment, so it didn't affect me as much.
When I was in school, I was able to focus on school, and when I was in an abusive situation, I was able to focus my energy on getting through it. Separating these worlds allowed me to learn and grow as a child while simultaneously experiencing abuse. 
It seems like the shuffling of my sense of time is a side effect of my constricted awareness.

Now as an adult, I've continued to live my life in such a compartmentalized way that I'm only fully aware of what is currently going on in the compartment I am in---I've learned to live life in the moment-to-moment, without a more broad awareness of my past and future.

This level of constricted awareness has made my day-to-day functioning difficult.

I learned how to split parts and compartmentalize experiences as a coping mechanism as a young child, and because it was so effective, I've continued to use it as an adult. For me, what started as a beneficial coping mechanism seems to have gone out of control as I've used this strategy to cope with adult stressors. As a result, I now have many parts that I switch between on a regular basis with varying degrees of awareness between them. When I was younger, I seemed to have a much more structured and organized system, with each part having a unique job. Now, my system is much more chaotic, with multiple parts vying for the same job. So, for example, I have multiple different work parts that don't have full communication between them, so I can do one session of work as one part and then when I inevitably switch to a different work part, I may have difficulty picking up where the last part took off. This wasn't always the case---for most of my undergraduate years, I only had 2 main work parts who seemed to work well together. I only created many work parts when my work became a major source of stress in graduate school. Now, I have countless work parts with that don't have full awareness between them[^2].

[^2]: This can be verified by looking how my handwriting has changed through the years.
Externally, this appears that I am slacking on my work responsibilities, but in reality the intention is different---sometimes I genuinely do not know I am supposed to be working.

, as each part had its role in my life so I 

However, the way I seem to experience this is incredibly subtle.
How does this affect me?
it allows me to only be aware of the activities current environment that I am in. 
 It seems as though if Part A is active for  a period of time and Part B takes over, when Part A is active again (or, when I am in Part A's compartment of memory again), stuff that occurred when Part B was out feels like it occured longer ago than when Part A was active.
I suspect that others with more identity alteration would 

These experiences are just subtle enough for me to question if they are actually significant, or if everyone experiences them and I'm just being . 
Because the way I navigate throughout life involves switching between compartments of memory, and when I'm in one compartment I may remember different things about my life due to what I experienced while I was in that compartment of memory in the past, my awareness at any given time is constricted.

When the abused part was out, I would be able to focus all of my energy on minimizing the abuse, 

. What exactly I'm aware of depends on which memory compartment I'm in.
