                    <description><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a dominant representation of DID in online discourse. Mostly, it seems as though people represent themselves as having a handful of well-defined parts, each with distinct names, ages, and characteristics. Perhaps because I am <a href="/posts/polyfragmented/">polyfragmented</a>, I experience something very different, and do not relate to the vast majority of the experiences that other people present themselves as having online. Last month, I posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/">the DID subreddit</a> to see if anyone related to my experiences:</p>





<div class="paige-quote">
    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone relates to my experiences, as I have not seen this representation of DID anywhere in the literature/online.</p>
<p>I have polyfragmented DID, with low identity alteration, day-to-day amnesia, and lots of switching (10-100+ times a day).</p>
<p>The last several years of my life have been a blur. However, I have been logging data about myself for the past ~2 years, and I have now accumulated enough to notice patterns. From this, it seems like my parts exhibit cyclical behavior. It seems like I have one part as my dominant part for anywhere from several hours to a few weeks. During this time, other task-based and trauma-holding parts seem to &ldquo;come out&rdquo; of that dominant part as needed. Eventually, a new dominant part takes over, and lasts a chunk of time before a different one takes over. After I have cycled through all of these dominant parts, they repeat in a similar order, with a period lasting ~3-5 months. Occasionally, new parts are added to this cycle. I have not yet gained enough internal awareness to know which &ldquo;part of the cycle&rdquo; I am in in a given moment, but if I look back at my data, it&rsquo;s clear that I have cyclical patterns across several different data points.</p>
<p>Does anyone here exhibit anything similar to this? Do you know of others that experience this system structure? Do you have any tips for the recovery process?</p>
<p>With this awareness, my life makes a whole lot more sense. I spend much of my time confused and out of date about where I am in life, as many of my parts are unaware of large aspects of my life. Because my dominant parts switch so readily, I&rsquo;m repeatedly having to re-update myself about my life circumstances (if I&rsquo;m even aware enough about my current life to do so!), and since these parts only repeat every few months, each part of me feels like they are losing large chunks of time. Life is so chaotic right now. I am in therapy 2x a week and am slowly making, and subsequently losing, progress. Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>You can view the original Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/166f8ui/polyfragmented_did_cycling_between_parts/">here</a>.
I received a lot of comments on this post, with many people relating to my experiences and sharing their own.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a very uncomfortable and unknown form of DID to have. My sense of self changes so rapidly, and internally things are very chaotic. It&rsquo;s hard to definitively describe what I&rsquo;m experiencing, as things change quickly enough that I often forget what I previously discovered. The only way I am able to confirm that this is actually what I am going through is because I have compiled enough data about myself to determine that I have clear cyclical patterns (see <a href="/posts/systemdata/">Learning about my system with data</a>).
Internally, things were too chaotic for me to discover this pattern independently, but now that I know that this is how I work I can confirm the pattern fits with my internal experiences as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reassuring to know that other people are going through similar experiences to me. At least one person said they experienced this at earlier stages of their recovery and their system is more stable now. I&rsquo;ve been in therapy for just over 1.5 years, and I believe this system pattern began in late 2019 due to the stress caused by my PhD qualifying exams. Before taking my qualifying exams, I had two main handwritings that would show up in my academic notes, and were stable for at least the previous 5 years. After my qualifying exams, which went horribly and could be considered traumatic for me, I gradually gained more and more different handwritings as more parts were being created and added to the cycle. Now, I have an uncountable number of distinct handwritings that I switch between seemingly cyclically.</p>
<p>It seems like, depending on which part of the cycle I am in, I have very different understandings of my life. I talk about this in <a href="/posts/howdidaffectswork/">How DID affects my work</a>. I can go for weeks where I am hyperfocused on work and advancing in my research, followed by weeks where I am mostly unaware that I am even a graduate student who is supposed to be working. I am trying hard to break this cycle, but it seems to be going strong. There have been several occasions where I believed I was able to stop my cycle (for example, see <a href="/posts/wakingup/">Waking up to the present</a>), but I always end up losing my awareness and advancing in the cycle. I hope someday soon my system will stabilize more so I can live the life I want to live and remain grounded to the reality of the present.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Life is moving very rapidly right now. I wrote the previous post (<a href="/posts/wakingup/">Waking up to the present</a>) six weeks ago, shortly after I had split a new cluster of parts. Then, three weeks ago, I split a whole new cluster of parts. Both six weeks ago and three weeks ago I had very distinct changes in my behavioral patterns and how I operate. I have two very distinct &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; in my continuity of memory both three and six weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have been creating new clusters of parts due to stressors for my whole life, but up until recently I wasn&rsquo;t aware I was doing it&mdash;it was &ldquo;normal&rdquo; to me, so I didn&rsquo;t know anything was off. Until I learned that I had DID, I didn&rsquo;t have a framework from which to understand my experiences. Since starting therapy for DID, I have become much more aware of my internal states and, with lots of practice and observation, I am now generally able to tell when I have switched between or created new compartments of memory.</p>
<p>While cultivating my internal qualitative awareness of my system is important, I am a very quantitative-minded person&mdash;I want hard, solid evidence that what I am going through is actually happening. And now I finally do.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started tracking information about my life and logging it in a database. I started small, tracking simple things like medications taken, my weight, and when I showered. Over time, I started tracking more and more complex things as I became more aware of patterns in my life. For example, there are times when I have a distinctly different gait than normal, and other times where I chew my tongue habitually in a distinct way, along with many other factors. I also automatically log certain things such as the activity on my computer and phone, along with steps taken and when I fall asleep/wake up every day. I generally log the activities of what I do in a day, in broad categories such as work, eating, and walking, over time.
I now have tens of thousands of data points about myself, spread over a few years, from which I can draw conclusions off of.
I also journal every day, in both a personal journal and a work journal, so I also have a lot of free-form data along with handwriting from that.</p>
<p>Now, looking at my data, across multiple factors, I see distinct changes in how I operate both three and six weeks ago. Internally, I already knew this, but having physical data to back up my internal awareness definitely validates my understanding of my system.
In addition to providing solid quantitative evidence of my system, logging data about myself requires me to be observant and mindful of my life&rsquo;s activities, which in turn helps me to gain internal awareness of how I operate.</p>
<p>In a way, I am collecting data about myself to solve an inverse problem. Given the data that I acquire about myself, can I determine the underlying model about how I operate? With time, as I acquire more data, its becoming increasingly more clear. I am figuring out how I operate, slowly but surely, using the best way I know how&mdash;using data.</p>
<p>I feel I am in a different stage of recovery now than I was even a few months ago. I have become much more aware about who I am and how I operate. I am an amalgamation of hundreds of parts who are working together, with varying levels of cooperation, to live life. As life goes on and the data I collect about myself along with my awareness grows, my confidence about the way that I operate increases. I can now definitively say that I am a polyfragmented system operating with hundreds of parts, many of which are fragments. I split parts regularly, and switch between my parts a handful to hundreds of times a day. I have different scales of parts&mdash;while I have parts that I switch between every day, I also have longer-scale parts that I shift between on the order of days to weeks. My longer-scale parts seem to be roughly cyclical, and seem to repeat on the order of a few months, seemingly dependent on life stressors. On the other hand, my daily parts seem to come out much more consistently due to more concrete triggers, such as task-based reasons or reminders of trauma.</p>
<p>Since capturing long-scale variations in data is much simpler than capturing short-scale variations in data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I am currently more focused on capturing my long-scale parts. With time and increased awareness, I hope to be able to acquire more data about my parts that switch more frequently.
But with the data I have now, I have made a few observations.
Depending on which &ldquo;part of the cycle&rdquo; I am in (in other words, which long-scale part is out), the way I operate in life is distinctly different. This includes things like my bedtime and morning routine, how well I cook and the foods I eat, my hobbies and interests, how aware of/productive I am at work, how often I shower, how long/frequently I walk, my handwriting, my gait, how often I socialize/interact with others, the video games I play and how often I play them, how interested I am in/how frequently I use marijuana, how much I am aware of/interested in my pets and plants, my awareness of my past and my future, how clean my apartment is, how aware I am of my appearance, how connected I am with my body/how sensitive I am to pain, my outlook on life, my entire internal experience, and many other things that are too personal to list here.
While for a long time I was suspicious that this was my system structure and the way that I operate, I now have sufficient enough data for me to be convinced that my model is correct.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I began therapy for DID in January 2022, I had no idea how much my life had already spiraled out of control. Over the course of several years, I had gone from being a high-achieving student at the top of my class to being effectively unable to work because I was so triggered by the world around me.
However, because of my severe internal compartmentalization, I was unaware of my dysfunction&mdash;I had no idea anything abnormal was happening, and, for the most part, thought I was still the successful student I previously was.
I went from being an over-achiever to effectively dysfunctional.
This is because work went from a source of fun and inspiration to a source of stress, so work became triggering to me. There are a variety of factors that affect why work became so triggering, but the end result is the same&mdash;just as in the past I learned to avoid traumatic or stressful things by dissociating away from them, I continued the pattern and subconsciously learned to dissociate away from work.</p>
<p>Within my system structure, I have separate compartments for work, which are differentiated enough from my other compartments such that when the work parts aren&rsquo;t out, I&rsquo;m practically unaware of my work life.
However, because my work parts are so compartmentalized, when my work parts are out, I&rsquo;m able to hyperfocus on work, undistracted by the happenings of the world around me.
This is something I developed as a child&mdash;I learned to separate my work and home lives because they were so different.
When my system is running smoothly, the right parts come out on queue, working together harmoniously. My internal compartmenalization of different facets of my life has always been severe, and since it had had worked well in the past, I had never questioned it before.</p>
<p>During graduate school, over the span of several years, as work gradually became more and more triggering for me, my work parts slowly started coming out less and less organically. I began a cycle of behavior: when work was not stressful, I&rsquo;d work as normal. Then, when something stressful would come up, it&rsquo;d become much more difficult to work. For a period of time spanning days to weeks, I&rsquo;d be effectively unable to work, but I&rsquo;d be unaware that I wasn&rsquo;t working as normal. Then, I&rsquo;d inevitably become aware that I was &ldquo;slacking&rdquo; at work, and force myself to start work again, which was always incredibly difficult as I was working through being triggered. Once the stressor was alleviated or sufficiently forgotten about, I&rsquo;d be back to working as normal again. And then when the next stressor came up, the cycle would repeat.</p>
<p>This cycle has repeated at least a dozen times during my PhD thus far, and each time it has repeated, new parts would be created to &ldquo;take control of my life again&rdquo; once I realized I was not working productively. Because of this, my awareness of my work life has become increasingly fragmented. For me, my handwriting is a great indicator to differentiate between parts.
For most of my undergraduate years, I had two main handwritings, indicating the two main work parts who were consistent through the entirety of undergrad. But in graduate school, my handwriting has become much more inconsistent. Because of the way I&rsquo;ve split work parts, I can see in my academic journal that, over the span of several months, I&rsquo;m writing the same concepts down over and over again, all in different handwritings. I have difficulty picking up where the previous part left off, so I practically have to start my work all over again once a new part is created. It&rsquo;s clear that I&rsquo;m trying really hard to advance in work, but because I&rsquo;m creating new compartments to work as opposed to utilizing the old ones, my awareness of my work life has become extremely fractured and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Why am I creating new parts instead of using already created work parts? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I can speculate. I believe it&rsquo;s because <a href="/posts/polyfragmented/">I am polyfragmented</a>, so I create parts really easily. And because the previous parts I subconsciously create to take control of my life eventually become too stressed to come out, I create new parts who are unaware of the stress in order to advance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me an incredibly long time to gain the insight that I have now, and even now that I&rsquo;ve gained this insight, it&rsquo;s hard for me to break the cycle. Right now, I&rsquo;m at the stage that I&rsquo;m aware that this is how I operate, but I&rsquo;m not yet at the place where I&rsquo;m able to change it&mdash;I&rsquo;m stuck observing my cyclical parts.
I seem to have very little control over what goes on in my life, but it&rsquo;s starting to get better.
I am learning to become aware of what stage of the cycle I&rsquo;m in at any given time, which has allowed me to stay in the stage where work parts are out longer and the stage where I&rsquo;m dysfunctional shorter. I&rsquo;m making progress, but it&rsquo;s slow and incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>I truly hate that this is the way I operate. I do not enjoy being so stressed by my work that my dissociative defenses are constantly activated. There are large spans of time where I&rsquo;m totally unaware of work because I&rsquo;m so stressed by it, followed by times where I&rsquo;m hyperaware of how much I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;slacking&rdquo; on work and have to pick up the pieces, over and over again.
To be clear, I do not believe I&rsquo;m &ldquo;slacking&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m in a stage of the cycle where I&rsquo;m unable to work. Rather, I consider myself to be in a triggered state that I have little to no control over. But from the outside looking in, if one is unaware that I have DID, it really looks like I do not care about my PhD and am intentionally slacking on my responsibilities.
This has been incredibly frustrating to come to terms with, as my behavior is still mostly out of my control as I am constantly responding to triggers in my environment, yet I have the strong desire to break the cycle.</p>
<p>What is the path forward? Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to stop this cyclical behavior so I can work as normal again. I want to stop creating new parts when I get too stressed. I want to have one or two dedicated work parts out like I did in my undergraduate years so my awareness of my work life isn&rsquo;t so fragmented. I want to stop being so triggered by work that my dissociate defenses are constantly activated. I truly just want to become productive at work again, and while I see the light at the end of the tunnel, I have a long way to go before I get there. For now, I&rsquo;ll take it one day at a time, as I slowly take back control of my life.</p>
