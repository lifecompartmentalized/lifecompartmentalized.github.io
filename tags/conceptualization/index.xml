                    <description><![CDATA[<p>One&rsquo;s early childhood experiences can majorly influence how they perceive the word. Because I experienced repeated trauma in my early years, my brain wired with the knowledge that the world around me was not safe and my experiences were not in my control. In order to cope with this, I learned to escape my external reality by curating my own internal reality&mdash;I created a world that only I could control, which was only limited by my own imagination.</p>
<p>This curated internal world isn&rsquo;t a distinctly separate reality from the external world. Rather, this internal reality runs in parallel to the true external reality&mdash;it acts as a filter to remove certain aspects of my life from my awareness. My internal reality was curated by the innocence and naivety of a young child who only wanted to see good in the world. Because of this, I developed a strategy to filter out the negative aspects of life and only allow in the positive ones. I&rsquo;d disown experiences of hardship and abuse and accept experiences of love and kindness as my own.</p>
<p>In my distorted internal reality, everyone is kind and has good intentions. In the true external reality, people can be deceitful and malevolent. In my distorted internal reality, I was exclusively loved and cherished by those around me. In the true external reality, I was frequently controlled, disrespected, and abused. In my distorted internal reality, everything in life was wonderful and I had no negative experiences. In the true external reality, life naturally has both positive and negative components, and both are valuable for personal development and growth.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, this
internal world was always there as my escape from the harshness of the external world around me.
Escaping to my curated internal world is habitual&mdash;by default, I only see the positive components to life.
This strategy of only owning positive experiences and disowning all others maximizes my internal comfort, but comes at the expense of missing out on large aspects of my life&mdash;anything that the filter created by my young self deems as negative is immediately disowned and forgotten about.
Because I see the world in this way, I often miss red flags and fall for deceptive behavior, which makes me vulnerable to people with ill-intentions.
When times are stressful, I by default enter this world and disconnect from my external life. Because of this, I have missed out on years of my life as I escaped to my internal reality instead of addressing issues in my external reality.</p>
<p>Until recently, I had no idea that the way I perceived the world was distorted.
During my early adulthood, my life experiences were mostly pleasant&mdash;my filter didn&rsquo;t remove too much information from my awareness.
However, over the past ~5 years, my life has gotten progressively more stressful due to various external circumstances. Over this time, I retreated into my mind more to cope, causing me to become increasingly confused about my external life.
While this was happening, I became unaware about large aspects of my life, which made me miss out on many opportunities for personal and professional growth.
As I increasingly retreated into my mind, I was genuinely unaware that anything abnormal in my life was happening.
It took me a very long time, support from those around me, and a DID diagnosis to become aware that I was escaping my life in unhealthy habitual ways.</p>
<p>I have now gained enough insight to be aware that my default internal state is one of optimism and innocence. While this is an internally comforting view to have, holding onto this view requires me to perceive the world around me in a distorted way. I can either live in my own comfortable internally reality and miss out on my external life, or I can connect with true reality and have a more nuanced view about life. The most internally comforting thing to do would be to stick with my own internal reality and let my external life pass me by. However, not all parts of me are okay with this plan&mdash;there&rsquo;s so much to life that I&rsquo;m missing out on by escaping into my mind.</p>
<p>During my recovery process, I&rsquo;m trying hard to break free from this different reality and connect myself to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; around me. I often get glimpses of it, but I inevitably fall back into my own world. My awareness of my life and the world around me fluctuates readily depending on which part of me is active, whose reality I am connected to, or which lens I am viewing life through. I have periods of time where I am connected to the world around me and can make progress in advancing my life, followed by large chunks of time where I automatically escape back into this distorted yet comforting reality. I am pushing hard to escape from my internal world so I can advance in and enjoy my external life.</p>
<p>I am very grateful that my internal experience was curated in this way. It has allowed me to live a wonderful life despite the hardships I have gone through. This distorted reality has saved me from immeasurable amounts of emotional pain and has filled my internal world with love, wonder, and innocence. But in order to live life to the fullest, I need to realize that this view of life is neither accurate nor complete.
While it has served me well in the past,
my goal is to break free from this curated reality that maximizes internal comfort in exchange for a more complete life.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Life is moving very rapidly right now. I wrote the previous post (<a href="/posts/wakingup/">Waking up to the present</a>) six weeks ago, shortly after I had split a new cluster of parts. Then, three weeks ago, I split a whole new cluster of parts. Both six weeks ago and three weeks ago I had very distinct changes in my behavioral patterns and how I operate. I have two very distinct &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; in my continuity of memory both three and six weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have been creating new clusters of parts due to stressors for my whole life, but up until recently I wasn&rsquo;t aware I was doing it&mdash;it was &ldquo;normal&rdquo; to me, so I didn&rsquo;t know anything was off. Until I learned that I had DID, I didn&rsquo;t have a framework from which to understand my experiences. Since starting therapy for DID, I have become much more aware of my internal states and, with lots of practice and observation, I am now generally able to tell when I have switched between or created new compartments of memory.</p>
<p>While cultivating my internal qualitative awareness of my system is important, I am a very quantitative-minded person&mdash;I want hard, solid evidence that what I am going through is actually happening. And now I finally do.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started tracking information about my life and logging it in a database. I started small, tracking simple things like medications taken, my weight, and when I showered. Over time, I started tracking more and more complex things as I became more aware of patterns in my life. For example, there are times when I have a distinctly different gait than normal, and other times where I chew my tongue habitually in a distinct way, along with many other factors. I also automatically log certain things such as the activity on my computer and phone, along with steps taken and when I fall asleep/wake up every day. I generally log the activities of what I do in a day, in broad categories such as work, eating, and walking, over time.
I now have tens of thousands of data points about myself, spread over a few years, from which I can draw conclusions off of.
I also journal every day, in both a personal journal and a work journal, so I also have a lot of free-form data along with handwriting from that.</p>
<p>Now, looking at my data, across multiple factors, I see distinct changes in how I operate both three and six weeks ago. Internally, I already knew this, but having physical data to back up my internal awareness definitely validates my understanding of my system.
In addition to providing solid quantitative evidence of my system, logging data about myself requires me to be observant and mindful of my life&rsquo;s activities, which in turn helps me to gain internal awareness of how I operate.</p>
<p>In a way, I am collecting data about myself to solve an inverse problem. Given the data that I acquire about myself, can I determine the underlying model about how I operate? With time, as I acquire more data, its becoming increasingly more clear. I am figuring out how I operate, slowly but surely, using the best way I know how&mdash;using data.</p>
<p>I feel I am in a different stage of recovery now than I was even a few months ago. I have become much more aware about who I am and how I operate. I am an amalgamation of hundreds of parts who are working together, with varying levels of cooperation, to live life. As life goes on and the data I collect about myself along with my awareness grows, my confidence about the way that I operate increases. I can now definitively say that I am a polyfragmented system operating with hundreds of parts, many of which are fragments. I split parts regularly, and switch between my parts a handful to hundreds of times a day. I have different scales of parts&mdash;while I have parts that I switch between every day, I also have longer-scale parts that I shift between on the order of days to weeks. My longer-scale parts seem to be roughly cyclical, and seem to repeat on the order of a few months, seemingly dependent on life stressors. On the other hand, my daily parts seem to come out much more consistently due to more concrete triggers, such as task-based reasons or reminders of trauma.</p>
<p>Since capturing long-scale variations in data is much simpler than capturing short-scale variations in data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I am currently more focused on capturing my long-scale parts. With time and increased awareness, I hope to be able to acquire more data about my parts that switch more frequently.
But with the data I have now, I have made a few observations.
Depending on which &ldquo;part of the cycle&rdquo; I am in (in other words, which long-scale part is out), the way I operate in life is distinctly different. This includes things like my bedtime and morning routine, how well I cook and the foods I eat, my hobbies and interests, how aware of/productive I am at work, how often I shower, how long/frequently I walk, my handwriting, my gait, how often I socialize/interact with others, the video games I play and how often I play them, how interested I am in/how frequently I use marijuana, how much I am aware of/interested in my pets and plants, my awareness of my past and my future, how clean my apartment is, how aware I am of my appearance, how connected I am with my body/how sensitive I am to pain, my outlook on life, my entire internal experience, and many other things that are too personal to list here.
While for a long time I was suspicious that this was my system structure and the way that I operate, I now have sufficient enough data for me to be convinced that my model is correct.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody, regardless of if they have DID or not, has parts of their personality. For example, one may generally behave differently at work with their colleagues than they do at home with their family&mdash;they have a &ldquo;work self&rdquo; and a &ldquo;home self&rdquo;.
In someone without DID,
when one transitions between their work self and their home self, they likely have a continuous internal sense of memory and identity&mdash;when they&rsquo;re at home, they still remember what happened while they were at work and relate to those experiences. Using graphs, we can represent the relationship between their work self and their home self with two nodes, each denoting a part of their personality, and one edge connecting the nodes, relating the shared sense of memory and identity between the two parts.



<script src="/cytoscape/cytoscape.min.js"></script>

<div >
<div id="twoparts" class="graph"></div>
<script src="/cytoscape/twoparts.js"></script>


Here, in an individual without DID, their work self and their home self are aware of and relate to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the other part.
But people have more than just a work self and a home self&mdash;they have a multitude of parts, representing many different facets of their personality. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake we will only look at 6 of these parts to represent their entire personality.
In an individual without DID, their parts form a complete graph&mdash;all the nodes are connected with edges to all the other nodes, representing that all their parts remember and relate to the actions of other parts.</p>



<script src="/cytoscape/cytoscape.min.js"></script>

<div >
<div id="singlet" class="graph"></div>
<script src="/cytoscape/singlet.js"></script>


<p>The similar colors of the nodes, or parts, represents the small variations between parts of their whole personality.
Because their parts are familiar with and aware of one another, their changes in identity and experience would generally blend smoothly between their parts.</p>
<p>Things may be a bit different in an individual with DID. While they still may have similar types of parts to someone without DID, their graph may look something like this:</p>



<script src="/cytoscape/cytoscape.min.js"></script>

<div >
<div id="system1" class="graph"></div>
<script src="/cytoscape/system1.js"></script>


<p>Their parts do not form a complete graph&mdash;the lack of connection between their parts represents the lack of continuity of memory and identity between parts of self. The different colors represent that their identity and personality variation is likely to be larger than that of a more integrated individual because their parts are more separated.
In an individual with DID, when one part of them is active, they may experience the world in an entirely different way than when a different part is active. They may have a different awareness of their life, different memories, and have a different felt sense of identity. Their life is compartmentalized into different pockets of awareness, identity, memory, and experience that they switch between to experience life. Not all of their parts are aware of the feelings and actions of other parts, and this is by design&mdash;from a young age, they learned to separate parts of self who hold difficult memories and experiences from other parts of self. This separation of parts of self is protective, as it allowed them to learn and grow as a child when some parts of them were active, while simultaneously using different parts to compartmentalize traumatic experiences away from the more healthy parts of self.</p>
<p>It is important to note that just as everybody&rsquo;s personality structure is different from one another&rsquo;s, people with DID are going to have different system structures, which depend on their reactions to their individual life experiences.
While some people may have parts that are well-defined and differentiated, others have systems of parts that are less structured.
Some may have parts that can fit into categories such as &ldquo;work self&rdquo; and &ldquo;home self&rdquo;, while others do not.
Some may have multiple parts that do the same job, and other parts that don&rsquo;t have clearly defined jobs.
In my case, while I do have parts that I could represent in a graph like this, my system of parts doesn&rsquo;t fully fit into a neat, clearly-defined structure.
Also, because I am <a href="/posts/polyfragmented">polyfragmented</a> and thus create parts easily, I have multiple parts that do the same job.
As an example, part of my system structure looks something like this:</p>



<script src="/cytoscape/cytoscape.min.js"></script>

<div >
<div id="mysystem" class="graph"></div>
<script src="/cytoscape/mysystem.js"></script>


<p>This is a far overly simplistic view, and only shows the parts of my system structure that I am aware of and am comfortable sharing. Here, I use the weights of edges between nodes to represent how connected two parts are, I use squares to denote clusters of parts rather than individual parts, and I only show three parts in each cluster when there are typically many more.
In reality, I believe my awareness of my system is still too abstract for me to accurately represent it with a concrete graph structure<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
However, I feel as though graphs such as this one can be a good visual representation of how parts relate to one another in individuals with a dissociative disorder.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>To be more accurate, I&rsquo;d also probably need to use a directed graph to show the one-way amnesia I sometimes experience&mdash;a part may be aware of the actions of another part, but that other part isn&rsquo;t aware of the first part. This is quite common in my system.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you thought about how you conceptualize your internal experience, or the language you use to describe it? I personally hadn&rsquo;t given either much thought until I learned I had DID. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had a long journey of learning to understand how I operate, which has required me to think deeply about how to convey my experiences to others who likely do not operate in the same way that I do.</p>
<p>How one chooses to explain how they operate is complex and deeply personal.
As such, different people with DID may choose to convey their experiences in many different ways.
While some people are extremely creative in their portrayals of how they operate, I am someone who is more reluctant to portray myself in a way that others may deem as being too imaginative.
Because of this, I&rsquo;m still trying to find the language that feels most appropriate to describe my experiences.</p>
<p>The language one chooses is influenced by the underlying model that they use to understand what they are experiencing.
My experiences with DID seem to vary greatly, and range in severity depending on if I&rsquo;m experiencing a trauma trigger or not.
On the severe end, when parts take over my body, it can feel like I&rsquo;m being possessed and another being is controlling me.
On the other end, most often switching and shifting between parts feels so natural to me that I wonder if my experiences are even different than the norm.
To me, it seems that both these mundane and extraordinary experiences can be explained by the model of me switching, shifting, and being influenced by different compartments of memory and experience, which I call parts.</p>
<p>With time, I have realized that I see the world with multiple different perspectives&mdash;while I have the perspective of me as a whole person, I also see the perspectives of me as my individual parts.
The perspective of me as a whole person is something I was acquainted with before my DID discovery journey began, as it is what most people experience and is thus the societal norm.
On this blog, and when I discuss with others about my experiences, I typically portray the perspective of myself as a singular unified person as it&rsquo;s likely how the vast majority of people see themselves, but this language can be limiting to describe my experiences.
Writing from the perspective of me as a whole, these &ldquo;parts&rdquo; seem to be compartments of many different aspects of my life, such as memory and  identity, that I switch between to navigate through life.
For the most part, I only have the perspective of one part at any given time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and due to my degree of compartmentalization between parts, including amnesia and severely changing understandings of the world, depending on which compartment I am in I may have very different perspectives and things to say.
If I only portray myself as one singular unified person, I am misrepresenting aspects of my experience.
Thinking and writing as if I am a system of parts can enable me to explain experiences that simply don&rsquo;t make sense from the more restrictive whole-self perspective, like changing views about a topic, lapses in memory, possession-like experiences, losing time, and even quirks like handwriting and gait changes between parts.</p>
<p>Since starting therapy, I&rsquo;ve gradually learned to internally reference myself as a system of parts, yet I still translate that to a singular-self language when talking with others as I am hesitant to externally display my internal perspective with others.
I like portraying having a unified, singular-self view of life, even though it doesn&rsquo;t fully reflect how I&rsquo;ve learned to perceive myself.
This is probably due to the fact that it makes me uncomfortable realizing others know that the way I internally refer to myself is different than the norm.
When I was young, I was more in-touch with my individual parts' perspectives&mdash;I would often refer to myself in third person in conversation with others<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I eventually learned that others did not experience themselves in this way, as I was occasionally ridiculed for it. I learned to hide using this language, even though it was the most accurate language for my experiences, since it was not well received by others.
Perhaps because of this, I feel the same way about using other unconventional language to describe my experiences&mdash;speaking from the perspective of individual parts, like I naturally did when I was younger, is tainted with shame due to my past experiences, and something I&rsquo;m working towards getting more comfortable with when appropriate in order to become more authentically me.</p>
<p>While I am used to thinking in third person<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, thinking about myself as multiple is new<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and I&rsquo;m still getting used to this conceptualization and the language used to describe it.
On this blog, I have decided to use whatever language is most appropriate for describing the particular experiences that I&rsquo;m trying to convey&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to limit myself to a particular conceptualization or vocabulary set. So while I have mostly written from the perspective of a unified self thus far, this may change as I learn what language and conceptualization feels most comfortable for me.</p>
