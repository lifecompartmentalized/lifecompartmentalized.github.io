                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a perfectionist. For most of my life, I thought that was a good thing. However, I now see how much it has negatively impacted my life. In this post, I explore my understanding one aspect of that&mdash;I believe that the combination of my perfectionistic tendencies plus my capacity to dissociate to a high degree is a main cause of my difficulties in the present.</p>
<p>Growing up, I strived to be the &ldquo;perfect child&rdquo;&mdash;I made good grades, never got into trouble, and was always submissive, smiling, and pleasant to be around. I made life incredibly easy for my parents and everyone else around me.
Of course, I had my difficult moments, but for the most part, my main goal in life was to embody perfection in every way possible.
And I believed that I succeeded.
However, while most parts of me strived for and held a perfect view of myself, not all parts of me met expectations.
In order to maintain my internal perception that I was perfect, I used dissociation to disown the parts of self and experiences that didn&rsquo;t fit my perfect view of self. Because I have DID, I learned the ability to subconsciously compartmentalize and disown any actions and experiences that are ego-dystonic, thus allowing me to curate my view of my self and the world around me.
In order to maintain this perfect self-view, I relied on maintaining dissociative barriers between parts of self&mdash;the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; parts of me disowned the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; parts of me, resulting in amnesia for times where I didn&rsquo;t meet my own inflated expectations.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was able to hold this perfectionist view of my life while still remaining functional. Although while in high school I had some academic difficulties, I found college to be pretty easy, primarily due to the fact that I had no life outside of school and academics. I strived to only earn As, and was successful, for the most part, because of how much energy I put into my studies. Overall, I had a pretty solid understanding and memory of my life during my undergraduate years, and showed effectively no negative symptoms of DID.</p>
<p>During grad school, things became more difficult. I was surrounded by peers who were more hard-working and intelligent than I was. I was taking classes that were more difficult than I was used to, along with doing research that I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had enough time or energy for. I struggled with the transition from undergrad to grad school, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it. My automatic response of disowning difficult experiences took over, resulting in me truly only seeing the &ldquo;good&rdquo; aspects of life. My worldview was so skewed towards the positive that I didn&rsquo;t see myself slipping more and more behind as my degree progressed. Parts of me held onto the perfectionistic view of self and life, while other parts of me were struggling with the reality of grad school, and neither parts were fully aware of the other parts. In grad school, my parts became more separated from each other than they had ever been before because I was not able to maintain the perfect view of myself, resulting in amnesia for large chunks of my grad school experience.</p>
<p>Over time, I went from functioning well at a high level to being effectively unaware of large aspects of my life and the world around me. I was not meeting my own expectations, and instead of allowing myself to realize that, I automatically turned to dissociation to make myself unaware of my perceived failings. While in reality, I was just encountering the stress that almost every graduate student faces, it was enough to trigger my dissociative defenses. However, I cannot emphasize enough that, for the vast majority of the time, I was simply unaware that I even had any stress or troubles because I had amnesia for those experiences. Thus, until starting therapy, I genuinely thought I was doing well in graduate school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only within the past year that I realized anything abnormal was happening. Last June, at the recommendation of others with DID, I started a journal to process my thoughts about my life. When I would read my journal back, I realized that there were entries in my journal that I didn&rsquo;t remember writing, in handwritings that I didn&rsquo;t recognize as my own. I&rsquo;d read these entries and see that they had a very different perspective of my life than I did. Over time, it became clear that I had separation between parts who were aware of my life&rsquo;s difficulties and those who were not. I had split parts to allow me to maintain my perfectionistic and positive world view.</p>
<p>Now, about 1.5 years after starting therapy, my amnesia surrounding negative life experiences has significantly improved. I now recognize my multiple handwritings and am mostly able to tell when parts who hold negative emotions, memories, and views of life are active. However, once more positive-viewing parts are out, I still have trouble relating to those negative emotions and experiences. I still generally have a positive view of life and self the vast majority of the time, but I&rsquo;m now also aware of the negative aspects of myself and life as well.</p>
<p>Having DID allowed to me believe that I truly <em>was</em> perfect. Not because I actually was&mdash;because nobody is&mdash;but because I would disown parts of self and experiences that didn&rsquo;t fit my perfectionistic view of myself, resulting in amnesia and an incomplete view of my life and circumstances. Because I strove for perfection over all else, I was able to mostly meet my perfecionsitic standards through high school and college&mdash;not much happened in my life then that fell outside of my range of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. In graduate school, however, I fell far behind because I wasn&rsquo;t able to meet my own expectations. I&rsquo;d then disown those experiences, leading to amnesia for large chunks of my life. When things got hard, I automatically relied on maladaptive coping mechanisms instead of fixing the problem at its root, resulting in more and more problems piling up. However, now that I am in touch with both the negative and positive aspects of life, I&rsquo;m more aware of my life circumstances and am functioning much better. I still have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m making progress to becoming a more integrated person every day. One of the most important lessons I&rsquo;ve learned thus far is that I am not perfect, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<!--
apparently too much for me to handle
For the most part, I would only remember the things in life fit my view of self. 

although there were instances that didn't meet my perfect standards, for the most part 
I would switch between states of only seeing the positives of my life, to only seeing the negatives 
In my elementary school, I was the only student in my year to never get a demerit during my time there. I was 

When working on something, I put my all into it and demand that my work be as close to 


However, I am now beginning to see the how much it has negatively impacted my life.

, as I belived that it got me to where I am today

(resulting in polyfragmented DID) 

I don't believe anyone explicitly asked me to do this. I believe my perfectionistic tendencies came from 

now realize how much the intersection of perfectionism plus having DID has severely impacted my life.
But while parts of me truly believed that I was infallible, in reality, I was
---especially in my early years as I was still establishing myself at undergrad, I'd spend much of my free time solving unassigned problems at the back of textbooks just to ensure that I truly understood the material in my courses

 I've since realized that my worldview was tainted by my skewed perception of myself and the world around me. 

I was a perfectionistic child. I had incredibly high standards of my output of work

Now, I could list a bunch of reasons 

I now a perfectionistic adult, but I'm working on it. 


I've always been a perfectionist. My standards of myself 

Up until recently

I've demanded perfection of my self, 

There wasn't much for me to disown---I met my expectations, for the most part, 

After all, nobody is infallible.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I switch a lot on a daily basis, probably because I am <a href="/posts/polyfragmented/">polyfragmented</a>. The vast majority of the time, however, I&rsquo;m switching between parts who are familiar with one-another, so this kind of switching is smooth, with only a small blip in my conscious awareness. I typically call this kind of switching <em>shifting</em>, because, although I am changing between parts, it isn&rsquo;t jarring and I don&rsquo;t feel like I have a loss of control&mdash;I am able to hold a conversation and mostly remember my train of thought while shifting between parts.</p>
<p>When I experience true switching, however, I may lose awareness of the world around me, in a time span range of anywhere from seconds to hours. Typically this disconnect feels gradual and seamless, so much so that, unless something notable happens while I was in the dissociated state so I come back to a discretely different situation than before the switch, I&rsquo;m usually not aware that I ever switched.
It can feel like I&rsquo;m waking up from a dream, and I&rsquo;m not fully aware if I&rsquo;m still dreaming or if this is my reality.</p>
<p>I see a lot of parallels in how I experience dreaming and how I experience switching between parts that aren&rsquo;t familiar with one another. When a trauma-holding part, one that my more regulated adult parts aren&rsquo;t acquainted with, is triggered to take control, it can feel like a kind of dream-state. Typically leading up to the switch, I start to feel heavy&mdash;my thinking slows down and my vision starts to fade. It feels slow, gradual, and, most importantly, natural. In reality, however, my switches are much faster than how they feel internally. When the part takes over, the dream-like state gets deeper. Most of the time, I&rsquo;m just along for the ride while the trauma-holding part has control. Everything feels a bit off, but I&rsquo;m usually not aware enough to even realize that. My thinking has slowed so far down that I&rsquo;m unable to grasp onto the reality of the situation. My vision has faded, and I have no control. My body is moving in ways that I have no awareness of, and time is suspended. I am not even aware that I do not have control because I&rsquo;m not aware of the world around me.</p>
<p>Since starting therapy, I&rsquo;ve been more able to identify when I&rsquo;m in this dissociated state.
This is because my therapist, who is able to recognize when I have dissociated, can prompt my adult parts to get back online by reminding me that we are safe and asking where my adult parts are.
When this happens, I&rsquo;m now able to do something analogous to lucid dreaming, where I am aware that something is off about my reality and I can sometimes exhibit partial control over the situation. I may be able to suggest to the part in control about what to do. I can tell the part, by thinking, that we are safe and update them on the reality of the situation. Sometimes, when this happens, my adult parts switch back in and I gradually gain control over the situation again. Other times, however, the part in control may get even more scared and confused about what is happening, resulting in an even more painful situation. For the most part, these trauma-holding parts aren&rsquo;t aware of present time and context, and think that trauma is happening right now, so they&rsquo;re often terrified.</p>
<p>It is a very strange feeling when a trauma-holding part is in control and I am simultaneously aware of the situation. I have a little control over my actions, but not too much. If, for example, I try to move my arm, my arm may feel so heavy that I am unable to move it. If I try to speak, I can feel like I am being blocked from doing so. Meanwhile, my body is moving in ways and I am doing things that I have no control over and cannot predict. Everything feels very slow, heavy, and visually dark. That part has more control over my actions than I do, and that part feels like a separate entity to me. Because of this, it can feel like I am possessed, so it can be a really scary experience for all parts involved.</p>
<p>Eventually, I switch back in and gain control again. While in reality this is typically an instantaneous switch, it feels like I&rsquo;m slowly waking up from a dream. After I&rsquo;m back in control, if I think back to what just happened, I&rsquo;m often genuinely unsure if what just happened actually happened. Sometimes, my memory of the event is simply not there. Other times, I remember only fractions of the time that the other part was in control. When I do remember the event, I typically only remember certain aspects of it&mdash;for the most part, my visual memory is not there, but I may remember what I heard while I was in a dissociated state. Sometimes, when I switch back, my memories of the event come back to me all of a sudden, as if to update me about what just happened but without having experienced it myself.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I was so used to entering and exiting this dream-like state where other parts have control that I genuinely didn&rsquo;t know it was abnormal&mdash;it was normal to me.
I was never consciously aware that other parts ever took over until starting therapy. At first, when this would happen in my therapy sessions, I&rsquo;d switch back after an episode to my therapist asking me if I knew what had just happened. I didn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;d pretend that I did because I didn&rsquo;t want to come to terms with the fact that I didn&rsquo;t.
Over time, my therapist was able to cue me forward when I was actively in a dissociated state, thus allowing me to become more aware while other parts were in control to help me create connections between my parts.
Now, I am more able to recognize when I am in a dissociated state, but I absolutely would not have been able to do so without having my therapist explicitly point it out to me first&mdash;I was simply unaware otherwise.</p>
<p>Having DID is a confusing experience, and it&rsquo;s really difficult to put into words the reality of my situation. Most of my life feels no different to anybody elses, yet I also have these otherworldy experiences. Up until recently, I wasn&rsquo;t conscious of the times that I didn&rsquo;t not have control over my life. Since becoming aware, the awareness of the lack of control over my own actions is, quite frankly, terrifying. I don&rsquo;t know what all of my triggers are, so I could, in theory, have a dissociative episode at any moment. Thankfully, I believe that the vast majority of these episodes occur in the controlled environment of therapy.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>One impactful symptom of DID that I struggle with is amnesia, which is significant enough for me that it impacts my daily functioning and severely affects my awareness of my life history.
I not only have difficulty constructing a functional narrative of my past, but I also often struggle with day-to-day amnesia.
The puzzling part of this all is that I seem to have gaps in awareness for things that are not at all trauma related. For example, I have at least one playful kid part, and after she has come out, my more regulated adult selves don&rsquo;t necessarily remember what I did when that part was out.
Additionally, when that kid part is out, I seem to have trouble fully remembering my adult life, along with my adult responsibilities.
Why is this? Why do my non-trauma-holding parts have amnesia for the actions of other non-trauma-holding parts? Isn&rsquo;t the point of amnesia to protect against difficult memories and experiences? Yes, but in my case, I believe it&rsquo;s also to protect me from the awareness that I have other parts of self with potentially ego-dystonic ways of being.</p>
<p>I believe I have day-to-day amnesia because I still haven&rsquo;t come to terms with the reality of having DID.
I have multiple versions of me that I switch between, and each only has a narrow view of how my life is supposed to function. The playful kid part doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with adult responsibilities, so she simply does not remember the boring aspects of my adult life. The more responsible parts of me do not want to realize that I can be so careless at times, spending hours obsessing over my fish tank and plants rather than dealing with the adult responsibilities that I&rsquo;m supposed to, so my responsible parts disown the actions of the kid part from my view of myself, resulting in partial amnesia.
My parts want to remain separate from each other because they each have different and conflicting ways of being in the world.
Different parts have different views of who <em>I</em> am, each following their narrow view of who they believe I am supposed to be.
In reality, I am <em>all</em> of my parts, and they are all me. I just haven&rsquo;t come to terms with that yet.</p>
<p>Since realizing this, I have tried to take on a new mindset of fully accepting all of my parts as they are.
However, since I&rsquo;ve spent my entire life operating with several disconnected versions of myself, each disowning the actions and experiences of the other parts, I have been incredibly unsuccessful at adopting this mindset thus far.
It&rsquo;s going to take a significant amount of effort, and a whole lot of teamwork between my parts, to change my ways and learn to accept all parts of myself.
The process of disowning the different versions of me has been an automatic process for my entire life thus far, so I can&rsquo;t expect this mindset change to be quick and seamless. I feel like I&rsquo;m at the stage now where I am aware of my parts, but still have not accepted them yet. I hope that, with time and acceptance, my amnesia will reduce and I will be able to gain more control over my life again.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>While I do experience what one could call &ldquo;dissociative episodes&rdquo; where a trauma-holding part takes full control of our body for a period of time, most of the time I experience momentary episodes of dissociation, where a part only takes control of our body for a few seconds at the maximum. However, these can still be difficult and disrupting to my daily life.</p>
<p>These types of episodes are quite common for me&mdash;they occur several times a day, often clustered together in time.
For that brief moment, my concentration is entirely focused internally, and I have no little to no awareness of the external world around me.
Simultaneously, my face and/or body may be moving in ways that I have no control over or awareness of. I may make noises, or mumble things, that are indicative of what&rsquo;s going on internally.
Internally, I am flooded by difficult emotions, such as fear or shame, along with an associated thought or memory. I perceive what I am experiencing internally as if it&rsquo;s happing in reality.
My heart rate may spike, and I may break into a sweat.
And then, all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s over, and I&rsquo;m back to doing what I was doing before, unphased by what just occurred.
These episodes can last from fractions of a second to several seconds, and occur several times a day.
After they&rsquo;re over, I can easily forget what went on during the episode or what triggered it. I describe one of these episodes in <em><a href="/posts/partscontrol/">The parts I don’t know about still have control</a></em>.
Within DID language, I could describe such an event by saying that a trauma-holding part that I do not have full memory sharing with was triggered and briefly took over.
These events seem to be triggered by either queues in my external environment or internal happenings that I, for the most part, seem to be unaware of.</p>
<p>From the outside, all of this happens so fast that if you blink you might miss it. Or, you may think it a tic, or a flinch. Personally, I try to hide them so they&rsquo;re as undetectable as possible to the outside observer&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to inadvertently let others know what I&rsquo;m experiencing.</p>
<p>From a therapeutic perspective, I&rsquo;m supposed to try and connect with these parts, or take a moment to reflect inwards, when they come up. However, I&rsquo;m so used to just moving on with my life after they occur, as I&rsquo;ve been doing my whole life, that it has become habitual. I typically don&rsquo;t even realize that I&rsquo;ve had one of these dissociative intrusions because they occur so frequently for me that I perceive them as being normal, and I rapidly forget that they even occurred and move on with life. I have too many of these a day to stop and reflect internally after every episode. I still see these episodes as a nuisance, rather than parts that are surfacing into my consciousness because they need help, as I should if I want to encourage integration between my parts. Healing is difficult work.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>DID is very much internal disorder. That is, unless I tell you that I have it, you wouldn&rsquo;t know<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. One of the ways DID affects my internal experience is that I have significant gaps in my memory, both of my past childhood, and of my present adulthood.
But amnesia is tricky&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t remember, so most of the time I don&rsquo;t realize I&rsquo;ve forgotten anything.</p>
<p>I believe I experience amnesia in a few ways.
The most innocuous type that I experience seems due to me having constricted awareness&mdash;each of my parts seems to act as a compartment of memory, so when I&rsquo;m in one compartment it may be difficult for me to index memories that occurred when I was in a different compartment of memory.
For example, if my partner talks about a hike we went on a few months ago when I&rsquo;m in a task-based compartment for cleaning, I may not remember the hike, but I may eventually get a very vague memory of it if they prompt me about it further. If I see a picture of us on the hike, it may help queue my memory of it more, but it still isn&rsquo;t a complete memory like it would be if I were in the compartment that was actually there on that hike.
I believe this is because hiking and cleaning occupy two entirely different compartments of my life; there&rsquo;s little in common between the two, and my constricted awareness makes it so that these memories aren&rsquo;t shared well between the two parts. This seems to be a version of state-dependent memory.</p>
<p>I also experience full amnesia between parts. That is, I will not have access to any of the memories of one compartment when I&rsquo;m in a different compartment. This typically seems to occur between compartments that hold trauma memories and ones that do not, but I also seem to experience this between non-trauma holding parts, and I&rsquo;m not yet sure why.</p>
<p>Within full amnesia, I seem to exhibit two types. The first is when I experience a discrete jump in my awareness when I switch between compartments where I have no idea what was happening just before the switch. This causes an obvious jump in my awareness, and may make it more noticeable that I have amnesia. I might find myself, all of a sudden, in a different room than I remember being in just a second ago, when in reality another part had moved me to that room outside of my awareness<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I experienced this when I was younger<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but not as much as I&rsquo;ve gotten older. Now, I more so seem to have a sliding-window type memory&mdash;rather than a discrete jump in awareness, my memory of what happened gradually disappears over several minutes after a switch. This leads to a perceived smoother transition between parts, making my memory loss less obvious to me.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of amnesia I have, I experience shuffling of memories and time jumps&mdash;I do not have a continuous, linear understanding of my life. For example, it may be hard for me to differentiate what occurred last week vs what occurred years ago, and sometimes things that occurred months ago feel more current to me than things that occurred even yesterday. As always, this seems to be justified by my understanding of how I operate&mdash;if I&rsquo;m in a compartment of memory that was last active a few months ago, those memories are more at the forefront of my awareness than memories formed in a different compartment yesterday.
This leads to a lot of confusing experiences, like looking out of my window and expecting it to be winter but seeing that it&rsquo;s actually summer, or all of a sudden noticing that the furniture in my apartment has moved from what I last remember, or looking at my plants and being amazed by how much they had grown because I remembered them being much smaller.
These sorts of experiences occur on an a weekly to daily basis for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still early on in my DID discovery journey, so my understanding of my amnesia will likely change over time as I learn more about how I operate.
I hope this post serves as a snapshot in time of my awareness of how I operate a little over one year after starting therapy.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine if, without your awareness, your deepest, most repressed thoughts and feelings were displayed for the world to see. With how my DID presents, this is something that occurs quite frequently for me. Because much of my most difficult emotions are separated from the core me, I am usually unaware of them until they surface and they&rsquo;re in the forefront of my awareness. Then, after they are over, I may forget that these dissociative episodes ever happened. This has led to me into many scary and sometimes dangerous situations, which typically leave me puzzled by what is happening in the world around me.</p>
<p>As an example, I like to go on evening walks for exercise. I typically walk one of a few routes in the densely populated city I live in. One day this past summer, I walked by a person who had some of the same characteristics as someone who caused me harm in the past. I walked by this individual without awareness that I was at all triggered. Then, in a split second, they started yelling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared of me, huh? What do you have to be scared about?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What?</em> It was so out of context for me; I had no idea why they were yelling at me. I wasn&rsquo;t scared of them&mdash;up until they started yelling at me, I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed them. I ignored them and calmly kept walking in the direction I was going. Then, they started moving towards me<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, continually yelling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you scared of me? You think I&rsquo;m threatening? There&rsquo;s nothing to be scared about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sped up walking and continued ignoring them. I felt very calm while this was happening, although I was confused by what going on. I eventually made it to the next block over and lost sight of them. I calmly walked home, and went out of my way to reassure myself that I had done nothing wrong, and that the person was at fault, not me. But <em>why</em> did this person think I was scared of them? Was I scared of them?</p>
<p>As it turns out, a part of me <em>was</em> scared of them. When I saw that person, that part became so scared, that they momentarily took control of our face and made a scared microexpression, directed at that person. However, I had no awareness that I was scared of them or that I had made any facial expression. This is because the parts of me who were on my evening walk were not connected with the part of me that was scared of the person, so from the perspective of the part of me that was going on a walk, I had no idea that anything abnormal was happening, while the scared part was simultaneously terrified.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, I intentionally went on my evening walk, purposefully walking past the location of the event to ensure I didn&rsquo;t associate anything negative with it. The parts of me walking felt perfectly fine, and I didn&rsquo;t realize anything was off.
Then, within a week, without realizing it, I stopped going on my evening walks. A month went by, and I still avoided walking, but it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me that I stopped.
I went from walking every day for months to only leaving my apartment when absolutely necessary. I didn&rsquo;t feel any fear associated with walking or leaving my apartment, but it was clearly there, dictating my behavior. It took over a month for me to realize anything was wrong, and once I pondered why I was no longer walking the reason became obvious&mdash;a part of me was still clearly scared of what had happened on that walk.
In order to get back to my walking routine, I gradually had to show that part that we were safe, and that that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen again, and even if it did, there were other parts who could take care of the situation like we had done last time. With this awareness in mind, over time, I managed to get back to going on my evening walks.</p>
<p>This is one example of how having DID affects my life and functioning. Before I became aware that I have DID, I was unaware of how much influence my parts had over my life. My behaviors are influenced by fear I cannot even grasp onto or feel. Other people may be more aware of my own internal state than even I am, since my body language may be contradictory to how I feel on the inside.
Getting to know my parts is helping me to become more aware of my internal state, and, in turn, will allow me to live a more complete life.</p>
