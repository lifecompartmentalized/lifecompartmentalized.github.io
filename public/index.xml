                    <description><![CDATA[<p>DID is very much internal disorder. That is, unless I tell you I have it, you wouldn&rsquo;t know <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. One of the ways DID affects my internal experience is that I have significant gaps in my memory, both of my past childhood, and of my present adulthood.
But amnesia is tricky&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t remember, so most of the time I don&rsquo;t realize I&rsquo;ve forgotten anything.</p>
<p>I believe I experience amnesia in a few ways.
The most innocuous type that I experience seems due to me having constricted awareness&mdash;each of my parts seems to act as a compartment of memory, so when I&rsquo;m in one compartment it may be difficult for me to index memories that occurred when I was in a different compartment of memory.
For example, if my partner talks about a hike we went on a few months ago when I&rsquo;m in a task-based compartment for cleaning, I may not remember the hike, but I may eventually get a very vague memory of it if they prompt me about it further. If I see a picture of us on the hike, it may help queue my memory of it more, but it still isn&rsquo;t a complete memory like it would be if I were in the compartment that was actually there on that hike.
I believe this is because hiking and cleaning occupy two entirely different compartments of my life; there&rsquo;s little in common between the two, and my constricted awareness makes it so that these memories aren&rsquo;t shared well between the two parts. This seems to be a version of state-dependent memory.</p>
<p>I also experience full amnesia between parts. That is, I will not have access to any of the memories of one compartment when I&rsquo;m in a different compartment. This typically seems to occur between compartments that hold trauma memories and ones that do not, but I also seem to experience this between non-trauma holding parts, and I&rsquo;m not yet sure why.</p>
<p>Within full amnesia, I seem to exhibit two types. The first is when I experience a discrete jump in my awareness when I switch between compartments where I have no idea what was happening just before the switch. This causes an obvious jump in my awareness, and may make it more noticeable that I have amnesia. I might find myself, all of a sudden, in a different room than I remember being in just a second ago, when in reality another part had moved me to that room outside of my awareness<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I experienced this when I was younger<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but not as much as I&rsquo;ve gotten older. Now, I more so seem to have a sliding-window type memory&mdash;rather than a discrete jump in awareness, my memory of what happened gradually disappears over several minutes after a switch. This leads to a perceived smoother transition between parts, making my memory loss less obvious to me.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of amnesia I experience, I experience shuffling of memories and time jumps&mdash;I do not have a continuous, linear understanding of my life. For example, it may be hard for me to differentiate what occurred last week vs what occurred years ago, and sometimes things that occurred months ago feel more current to me than things that occurred even yesterday. As always, this seems to be justified by my understanding of how I operate&mdash;if I&rsquo;m in a compartment of memory that was last active a few months ago, those memories are more at the forefront of my awareness than memories formed in a different compartment yesterday.
This leads to a lot of confusing experiences, like looking out of my window and expecting it to be winter but seeing that it&rsquo;s actually summer, or all of a sudden noticing that the furniture in my apartment has moved from what I last remember, or looking at my plants and being amazed by how much they had grown because I remembered them being much smaller.
These sorts of experiences occur on an a weekly to daily basis for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still early on in my DID discovery journey, so my understanding of my amnesia will likely change over time as I learn more about how I operate.
The way I experience amnesia seems to be more nuanced than what I have described here thus far, but I haven&rsquo;t formulated the words to fully describe these experiences yet.
I hope this post serves as a snapshot in time of my awareness of how I operate a little over one year after starting therapy.</p>
<!--


How does one know if the way they experience the world is _normal_? It never even occurred to me that aspects my experience could be considered disordered until recently. Now that I'm aware, so much of my life makes sense. 


These experiences can be explained by me switching between compartments of memory that I haven't been in in a while, and occur on an a weekly to daily basis for me.

Another type of amnesia that some people with dissociative disorders report[^3] is emotional amnesia, where they remember the events of what happened when they're in a different compartment, but don't have the associated emotions attached with that memory. I believe I experience this too, but because of the structure of my DID, I believe almost all of my memories do not have associated emotions attached to them[^6]. This seems to be my normal memory, so for me 
the distinction between experiencing emotional amnesia or having a "normal" memory isn't clear. I don't believe I often experience strong emotions[^4], though, so I'm not sure if I'm experiencing some sort of amnesia or if I just don't have the associated emotions to encode in my memories. 
[^4]: I don't remember what I don't remember, so maybe I do experience strong emotions more than I think; I'm honestly not sure.
[^3]: I learned about this from r/DID and r/OSDD on Reddit
[^6]: Also, most, if not all, of my memories seem to be in third person, even if they aren't trauma related. This may be why I don't have the first-person perspective of emotion attached to them.


In fact, one way I can differentiate between my parts is by 

it isn't clear if I could be experiencing something different.

so out of context for a part of me that cleans because it seems like a different section of my life.

I personally see myself as having three types of amnesia.

This memory will not be clear, and often has a "not me" feeling associated with it---it can feel like I'm indexing someone else's memories

I'm used to living with a constricted internal awareness that realizing I have amensia isn't surprising to me much anymore---it seems to be a normal part of my 

I'm only aware I'm in a different compartment when looking back in time. In the moment-to-moment, I always feel like _me_. That is; my sense of "I" does not change. This is why I like to conceptualize my experience as me switching between different compartments rather than 

Now that I know what switching feels like, I realize that I have day-to-day amnesia. 

When I look backat the 

I also often have the experience of 
Memory is tricky. When I think about my life, I am unaware I have amnesia

My whole life, I've had experiences where people claimed I had done things I had absolutely no memory of doing. These things seemed like things I would absolutely never do, and to be honest, I never thought too much about it.

In high school, I saw the same group of friends in class that I did outside of school. I clearly had different parts 

So now, looking back, of course I had amnesia. However, it's a lot more hidden than one would expect, because I simply do not remember what I do not remember. It's only when I have external sources notifying me that something happened that I didn't remember do I realize I must have had amnesia. 

It's honestly really scary know that I could potentially forget what I am doing right now in the future. How much of my life will I remember? Are these memories I'm making in my life encoding properly? I sure hope so---I don't want gaps in my memory.

With that being said, because I truly don't know what I don't know, I'm often not aware I'm missing anything.

My justification for these events was always that the other person was lying,

Is it amnesia proper, or is it just my awareness is so shuffled since I switch between many different compartments of memory in a day? 

At the end of the day, when my partner and I ask each other how our days were, I can typically give him a general impression of how the day went---I remember the major events 



One of the hardest parts of my DID discovery journey is coming to terms that I did, in fact, do those things. I had dissociated---putting me in a different compartment of awareness with a different mindset.

Who I thought I was is not who I actually was. Some parts 

I have difficulties tracking the passage of time. 
When I wake up in the morning, I have to orient myself to what day it 
Because I have so many different parts with varying levels of memory sharing between them, there are times where I won't know what I'm doing moment-to-moment.
the way I encoded and accessed memories was different from most others

In this case, it's not that I don't remember what happened when I was in a different compartment.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine if, without your awareness, your deepest, most repressed thoughts and feelings were displayed for the world to see. With how my DID presents, this is something that occurs quite frequently for me. Because much of my most difficult emotions are separated from the core me, I am usually unaware of them until they surface and they&rsquo;re in the forefront of my awareness. Then, after they are over, I typically forget that these dissociative episodes ever happened. This has led to me into many scary and sometimes dangerous situations, which typically leave me puzzled by what is happening in the world around me.</p>
<p>As an example, I like to go on evening walks for exercise. I typically walk one of a few routes in the densely populated city I live in. One day this past summer, I walked by a person who had some of the same characteristics as someone who caused me harm in the past. I walked by this individual without awareness that I was at all triggered. Then, in a split second, they started yelling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared of me, huh? What do you have to be scared about?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What?</em> It was so out of context for me; I had no idea why they were yelling at me. I wasn&rsquo;t scared of them&mdash;up until they started yelling at me, I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed them. I ignored them and calmly kept walking in the direction I was going. Then, they started moving towards me <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, continually yelling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you scared of me? You think I&rsquo;m threatening? There&rsquo;s nothing to be scared about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sped up walking and continued ignoring them. I felt very calm while this was happening, although I was confused by what going on. I eventually made it to the next block over and lost sight of them. I calmly walked home, and went out of my way to reassure myself that I had done nothing wrong, and that the person was at fault, not me. But <em>why</em> did this person think I was scared of them? Was I scared of them?</p>
<p>As it turns out, a part of me <em>was</em> scared of them. When I saw that person, that part became so scared, that they momentarily took control of my face and made a scared microexpression, directed at that person. However, I had no awareness that I was scared of them or that I had made any facial expression. This is because the parts of me who were on my evening walk were not connected with the part of me that was scared of the person, so from the perspective of the part of me that was going on a walk, I had no idea that anything abnormal was happening, while the scared part was simultaneously terrified.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, I intentionally went on my evening walk, purposefully walking past the location of the event to ensure I didn&rsquo;t associate anything negative with it. The parts of me walking felt perfectly fine, and I didn&rsquo;t realize anything was off.
Then, within a week, without realizing it, I stopped going on my evening walks. A month went by, and I still avoided walking, but it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me that I stopped.
I went from walking every day for months to only leaving my apartment when absolutely necessary. I didn&rsquo;t feel any fear associated with walking or leaving my apartment, but it was clearly there, dictating my behavior. It took over a month for me to realize anything was wrong, and once I pondered why I was no longer walking the reason became obvious&mdash;a part of me was still clearly scared of what had happened on that walk.
In order to get back to my walking routine, I gradually had to show that part that we were safe, and that that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen again, and even if it did, there were other parts who could take care of the situation like we had done last time. With this awareness in mind, over time, I managed to get back to going on my evening walks.</p>
<p>This is one example of how having DID affects my life and functioning. Before I became aware that I have DID, I was unaware of how much influence my parts had over my life. My behaviors are influenced by fear I cannot even grasp onto or feel. Other people may be more aware of my own internal state than even I am, since my body language may be contradictory to how I feel on the inside.
Getting to know my parts is helping me to become more aware of my internal state, and, in turn, will allow me to live a more complete life.</p>
<!--



It's not that I as a whole am not experiencing this fear; rather I simply am not connected with it. 


_Yeah, sure. You're chasing and yelling at me. Clearly there's something to be scared about_.
---my months long routine of going on an eveng walk ended, and I genuinely didn't even notice. I felt no fear associated with walking, but my behavior was controlled by the fear of that event occurring again, held by a part of me who wasn't connected with the core me.

About a month into stopping, I suddenly realized that I hadn't gone on a walk in a long time.
However, beyond my awareness, a part was terrified.  

 being mindful of my surroundings. I forced myself to walk past the location of the event again, trying to disassociate it with fear. 

I feel as though this is a classic example for how I ---my deepest emotions and fears, that I am not even aware of, can show up on my face for others to see without me even realizing it. 
One of the ways I experience DID is that the parts of me who hold onto traumatic memories and emotions are separated from the parts of me who

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The word I like best to describe my flavor of DID is polyfragmented.
Polyfragmented is most commonly referred to to mean someone who has a lot of parts and/or splits parts in a complex manner. I believe I exhibit both.</p>
<p>In a more traditional case of DID, it is my understanding that a person has a relatively small number parts that are more well defined. They only have a few compartments of memory, thus allowing them to spend more time in each compartment, so each compartment has more time to develop a distinct way of being. Their switches between these parts seem to be more pronounced since each part is more well defined.</p>
<p>I believe I experience something different. In addition to having several well-developed main parts, I also seem to have many fragments, or much less developed parts. It seems like, for the most part, these parts represent smaller fractions of my life than someone with a more traditional presenting form of DID. I have more parts, along with more fragmentation and less differentiation since each part had less time to develop a distinct identity.</p>
<p>Why do I have so many parts? I believe it&rsquo;s because the threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals&mdash;things that would be considered traumatic to me may not affect another person as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, life experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, because I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there&rsquo;s a high correlation between those who are polyfragmented and are autistic <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned that I have many different splitting patterns.
One such splitting pattern is that, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to split many parts in a sequential manner, which leads to a lot of parts being created for a single event.
I also do not only split parts due to trauma&mdash;I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rather than working with one part at a time, I&rsquo;m working with clusters of parts at any given time<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
I do not seem to have a &ldquo;host&rdquo;, or primary, personality. Instead, I have one of a few clusters of parts active at any given time, which seem to change from week-to-week and month-to-month in an approximate cyclical pattern.
My parts do not have names&mdash;they have labels<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
I shift and switch<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> between these parts at least a few dozen times a day, even without being triggered, because I have parts I need to access as a normal part of every day living<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.
Since my threshold for creating parts is so low, I believe I am still creating parts in the present-day.
My system isn&rsquo;t neatly organized and structured. It&rsquo;s chaotic, messy, and unknown.</p>
<p>Now, while this may sound like a difficult way to live&mdash;and in many aspects it certainly is&mdash;I believe the language used to describe this disorder makes it sound a lot more severe than it feels internally, at least to me.
I have had DID my entire life, and I have, for the most part, lived an enjoyable and conventionally successful life despite this. I know no other way of living&mdash;this is normal to me.
However, because of my system structure, I struggle with many aspects of time and memory<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, such as knowing what day, month, or sometimes year it is when I wake up in the morning, remembering what I did yesterday, or even 5 minutes ago, and losing anywhere from days to weeks of time due to a trauma trigger.
Only since learning that I have DID and gaining the language to describe my experiences did I know the way I experience the world is different from most others, and could be considered disordered. However, this is my normal, and always has been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me just over a year of therapy to get to the awareness I have today, and I know there&rsquo;s so much more I&rsquo;m unaware of.
When I take a step back and look at the facts of my situation, I can objectively see that I should be having a difficult time right now. However, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview.
My body is designed to deal with trauma, and learning about and working with my messy system could be considered just another trauma I&rsquo;m getting through.</p>
<p>Having polyfragmented DID makes my life very chaotic. I do not know how many parts I have, nor do I think I will ever know. I have to be okay with the unknown and be open minded about the information I learn about my system. I&rsquo;ve always lived this way&mdash;I just wasn&rsquo;t aware about it until now.</p>
<!--

I'm only at the beginning of my journey to discovering how I operate, and I'm learning more about my system every day. 

At the very begining of my journey to discovering how I operate, I never could have imagined that I had this chaotic of a system. 

I am not a singular part, with other parts being "other" to me, which is how some people seem to conceptualize having DID.
Rather, I am all of my parts, and all of my parts are me. These parts seem to represent pieces of the whole me. My life is fragmented into many different compartments that I switch between. Depending on which compartment I am in, I will have a different internal experience. For the most part, externally, there is not much differentiation between my parts. You will likely not be able to tell when one part is out vs a different part is out.



Many of my parts share memory and are cooperative with one another.
Right now, as I write this, 
up until recently, I was just as dysfunctional, but I didn't know I was because I didn't know I had DID and daily amnesia. Now that I am much more aware of what is going on in my life, I have full confidence that I will become more functional again soon. I have been very functional living with this disorder in the recent past, so I have full faith I'll get there again, this time with much more awareness of how I operate.






I seem to use parts differently than the most-shared representations of DID portray. Because of this, it took me an incredibly long time to see in myself that I had DID. 






I'd like to note that while I use the word "dysfunctional" to describe myself, I'm actually very high-functioning in most areas of my life. 
I use the word dysfunctional to describe the fact that this disorder is impacting my day-to-day functioning, making it hard to do the things I want to do. This is because my internal awareness is so fragmented that I do not have continuity of memory, and I have clusters of parts with different interests trying to live life in different ways, causing internal division. However, in many aspects of life, I am living functionally.



I'm using my dissociative coping mecahanisms to protect me from what could be objectively considered a difficult time, just as I have in the past. For the most part, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview. Dissociation is an amazing coping mechanism. 


For what it's worth, the labels I use to describe how I function make it seem like my life is a lot worse than it actually is. Despite the internal chaos and amnesia, I, for the most part, enjoy how I operate. I realize 

Thus, when I am triggered in the present day, I have to switch between a series of parts in rapid succession before switching back to an untraumatized part.
I am also able to take care of myself well, but 


This is the most descriptive word I've found used in the literature and online communities that represents how I experience having DID.
Most of my parts share memory between them, so switching/shifting can almost be undetectable to me. However, I do experience amnesia between some parts that come out nearly daily.
I seem to split parts easily and in a complex manner. 

With these splitting patterns, this means I have a lot of parts.

When I was young, I likely would not qualify as polyframented---my rate of part creation has increased as I aged 

I seem to have parts created to do jobs for me. For example, I have a few different parts dedicated to cleaning, a part for brushing my showering, and even a sequence of parts dedicated to getting me from putting my VR headset on to in my VR game as quickly/without my awareness as possible. My definition of what constitutes part creation is so low that a game loading screen made me create parts.

This is not a word I've seen in the academic literature, although Richard Kluft seems to describe similar phenomena in one of his papers[^1], so it's not concretely defined. To me, the word polyfragmented means a person who has many parts and/or splits them in a complex fashion. I believe I fall under the category of both. 
Because my understanding of DID was that of a more traditional presentation, I initially did not believe I had this disorder, despite having clear cases of amnesia. However, over time, I found that my presentation was simply different to the traditional presentation. It seems as though I 


rather than having a relatively few number of well-defined parts, 


Reading about experiences of people who self-identify as polyfragmented helped me to see that this label makes the most sense to me.

Because I switch so much, my relationship with time 

Rather than a few clearly defined parts, it seems as though my entire personality is split into multiple parts

My internal experience is extremely compartmentalized. When my symptoms are bad, I'm often living day-to-day, or even moment-to-moment, unaware of what I had previously been doing or what my next plans are. I feel like I'm in a state of survival---I just need to get through this moment onto the next day. This was a mindset I used as a child when I had to get through my current situation, but trusted there were good times ahead. I'd do whatever I could to pass time, to distract myself of the present moment so once the good times came, I could 

When times are good, 

However, in my adult life, this is a 
When I began graduate school, everything was stressful, and I was nearly constantly in this living moment-to-moment mindset, unable to take a step back and examine that 


I relied upon as a child to get me through times that were extremely stressful---I perceived the present moment as being bad, but I had faith that in the future. I used this when I had to get through a situation that took a long time

---the present moment is bad, but maybe the future will be better. I just need to get through this present moment to getas long as I could make it through the present moment, maybe the next. 

It took me several months of therapy with a dissociative disorders specialist in order for me to even consider that I had DID, despite having a pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis. Like many others would in my generation, as soon as I realized I was being assessed for DID, I immediately went to sites like Reddit and YouTube to see how other people with this disorder conceptualize their experiences. Needless to say, I did not relate to others' experiences that I found online. Most people I had encountered seemed to have a relatively small number clearly defined parts with clear roles. I genuinely did not believe that I had DID, despite the fact that I was frequently dissociating in therapy sessions without realizing I was doing so. 

Why do I have so many parts? The threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals---things that would be considered traumatic to me may not have affected another child as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, along with the fact that I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there's a high correlation of those who are polyfragmented and have autism.

What does this mean? It is my understanding that typically, individuals with DID split a few to several well defined parts---they don't have too many different compartments they switch between.


used colloquially to mean a system with many parts, typically with complex splitting patterns. 

I do not seem to experience this. Instead, 

I've also learned that I have many different types of parts and mechanisms for part creation.
I have many task-based parts, or parts that serve a specific job in my life, which leads to me needing to shift or switch[^6] between parts on a very regular basis.
Additionally, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to create many parts in a sequential manner, which leads to a lot of parts being created for a single event. 
I also do not only split parts due to trauma---I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged[^7].

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was 12, I stopped feeling anxiety. Prior to that, I was a child ravished by anxiety. Then, one day, it stopped <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. And I have never experienced anxiety in the same way since.</p>
<p>I now understand that anxiety is one of the experiences that I dissociated away&mdash;it&rsquo;s a state that I did not enjoy experiencing, so I learned how to compartmentalize it and push it out of my awareness.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not <em>experience</em> anxiety; rather, it means that when I do, I am so detached from it that I do not experience all aspects of it.</p>
<p>My body trembles, lower lip quivers, and heart races, yet I don&rsquo;t know why I am experiencing these physical symptoms.
My mind races with irrational thought loops, yet I can&rsquo;t quite grasp onto them so they feel like meaningless noise to me.
I am disconnected and emotionally numb. Except for when I am not.</p>
<p>When I am able to connect with the feeling of anxiety, it is all-encompassing and feels everlasting. When something triggers anxiety to the forefront of my awareness, it is all I can concentrate on, and I will do whatever I need to do to alleviate the feeling. Then, all of a sudden, it goes away as quickly as it came, and after it&rsquo;s over I gradually forget that it ever happened.</p>
<p>Right now, as I write this, I do not know what anxiety feels like. Parts of me do, but I am not connected with those parts. For the most part, I feel like an emotionless machine, going through the motions of life. Despite the fact that I&rsquo;m unable to connect with anxiety, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t affect me. My behaviors are controlled by fear and anxiety that I cannot feel&mdash;I can only intellectually infer that I am being affected by anxiety by examining my behaviors. I avoid leaving my apartment, interacting with others, and doing things that may eventually lead to stressful situations. Yet I do not experience the associated emotions with these behaviors&mdash;I am numb.</p>
<p>When I was 12, I didn&rsquo;t become a less anxious person&mdash;I just became more detached from my anxiety. My crippling anxiety wasn&rsquo;t miraculously cured. Instead, it was like fixing a wound that needed stitches with a band-aid&mdash;an easy, temporary solution that left me worse-off in the long term.</p>
<p>In order to decrease my amnesia and regain control of my life, I need to connect back with my anxiety.
Although it allows me to avoid difficult feelings in the moment, my current method of dealing with anxiety&mdash;compartmentalizing it and shoving it from my awareness&mdash;leads to uncontrollable fear-based behavior, a lack of internal awareness, and amnesia. I need to connect with this destabilizing experience once again, this time working though it instead of shoving it from my awareness. Then, I can address its root causes and gain control of my life again.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Pretty early on in my DID discovery journey, I realized that my handwriting was different depending on which part of me was writing. This was very useful information, as I had taken well-catalogued academic notes for years prior to starting therapy, so I had a solid bank of data of which I could look back on and see which parts of me were active at different times of my life.</p>
<p>One thing I quickly noticed was that any time I traveled to a conference, my handwriting changed. And then when I got back, my handwriting changed back to whatever was normal at that time of my life <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
Internally, this also made sense&mdash;I tend to index my life by location rather than time. In fact, in all of my notebooks' index sections, I had added a column for location, in addition to the standard page number and date. My mind likes segmenting my life based on location.</p>
<p>Why could this be the case? Why do I create parts when I travel? Looking back at my life story, it actually makes a lot of sense.
My first several years of life involved a lot of traveling. Although I was born in the US, when I was just over 2 months old, my family moved to the Middle East for my dad&rsquo;s job.
As a perk of being an expat, my dad&rsquo;s job paid for two vacations a year&mdash;one for rest and relaxation, and another to visit family.
Because of this, by my 5th birthday, I had been to 11 different countries between 4 continents, all on separate trips.</p>
<p>This sounds like an incredibly fortunate childhood, and while it was, it was also very stressful for me.
As an autistic person, I regulate myself by following a strict routine. As an adult, changes in plans are very dysregulating, and usually leave me in a detached dissociated state with difficulty picking up the newly created plans.
I can only imagine how dysregulating it was for me as a small child to have my routine entirely upended every several months to travel to a new environment with an unknown routine.
I had no option&mdash;my family chose to travel, and since within my family structure the emotional landscape was already dominated by others, I had to be an easy child and submit to whatever they wanted. This led to me dissociating and creating parts to handle the traveling for me.</p>
<p>This past summer, I went to my first conference while aware that I create parts this way.
The night leading up to the event, I remember absolutely dreading the trip, wishing I could back out but knowing that I couldn&rsquo;t. Then, when the time came, I genuinely enjoyed the conference&mdash;the right part showed up for the job. I did seem to create a part for this trip, and this was the first part that I was self-aware I was creating. I had no control over it; instead, I observed its creation as I walked into the hotel lobby to check in. A new persona emerged, and was ready to take on whatever routine was required of me for my week-long conference that was just getting started. With that part as the dominant part, other parts came out periodically to do what was required of me, like networking, socializing, and presenting. But this newly created part was the star of the show, helping me create a solid routine I could stick to throughout the week to help keep me regulated. Then, on the last day, once again the dread came&mdash;this time, I, as the newly created part, didn&rsquo;t want to change my routine back again as I was only familiar with the one I had created. However, when I arrived in my apartment after a long journey back, a different part switched in and I was so glad to be home and back again in my standard routine.</p>
<p>We traveled to many beautiful locations in my early childhood, and I truly appreciate all the culturally enriching experiences I acquired, which I believe to this day have helped shaped my worldview. I do, however, wish that my parents were more aware of how stressful this was for me as a child. I did not understand the significance of the locations we would visit, and felt as though I was being dragged from place to place without understanding what was going on around me. In pictures of our family vacations, it&rsquo;s clear that I am dissociating&mdash;many of them show me with a blank expression with my eyes glazed over. I learned to regulate myself by dissociating, detaching from the world around me. And these repeated experiences of traveling = part creation have continued throughout my life, increasingly fragmenting my awareness when I take trips.</p>
<p>I believe this is a good example of how trauma, but not necessarily abuse, can lead to the formation of DID.
I would not consider traveling as much as we did abuse, but it was traumatic because it was too much for me to handle at the developmental stages it occurred in.
One could argue that this was neglect or negligence&mdash;that my parents weren&rsquo;t attuned to my emotional needs at the time.
However, it does not fit into the category of extreme abuse that is often attributed to the creation of DID.
While I do not believe this was the only trauma that caused me to form DID, and some of those traumas would be considered abuse,
traveling in the way that we did when I was small had a major impact on how I create parts, and is perhaps the most influential mechanism of part creation in my adult life.</p>
<!--

One part of me is very grateful that I had traveled so much in my childhood because that meant that I had already seen everything I would ever to in life and would never have to travel again. That part of me sees vacations a check box to complete, rather than an experience to enjoy. This line of thinking was influenced by the stress I

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>&hellip; it&rsquo;s about childhood trauma.</p>
<p>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) can be thought of as a coping mechanism one may develop when they experience repeated trauma in early childhood. It is arguably one of the most misunderstood and controversial mental health conditions, perhaps because it&rsquo;s been repeatedly sensationalized in the media. Or, maybe because the name and clinical description of the disorder implies that it&rsquo;s about having multiple identities or personality states. However, these personality states are often incredibly subtle and are instead indicative of a post-traumatic reaction involving severe compartmentalization of experience.</p>
<p>DID is a highly individualized disorder which forms based off of one&rsquo;s reaction to their life experiences. As such, I can only speak for myself and how I personally experience this disorder. While DID can be difficult to understand, it can be thought of as being fundamentally about two psychological phenomena&mdash;<em>detachment</em> and <em>compartmentalization</em>. Using myself as an example, when I was small, there were times where I experienced severe repeated abuse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but at other times had a happy childhood. While I was being abused, I mentally <em>detached</em> myself from the situation&mdash;I disconnected from my body and the external world, choosing instead to escape into my mind to distract myself from a situation I knew no other way to get out of. Perhaps more importantly, I also internally <em>compartmentalized</em> the experience and shoved it from my awareness, effectively allowing me to forget that it even occurred after it was over as I lived an otherwise happy childhood<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Because this abuse occurred repeatedly, I continually used this strategy of switching to the compartment that held the abuse when I experienced triggers that the abuse was going to happen again. Then, when the abuse was over, I would switch back to the compartment that had a happy childhood and was blissfully unaware of the abuse that was taking place. This repeated pattern of switching between compartments further increased my compartmentalization of memory, awareness, experience, and identity. However, this was incredibly protective, as it allowed some parts of me to learn and grow as a child while other parts of me held the difficult memories and feelings of being abused out of awareness. All of this was done on a subconscious level.</p>
<p>This strategy of compartmentalization can only develop when trauma occurs in early childhood, while the brain still is rapidly developing and has the capacity to use such defenses. And because I learned to use these defenses when I was very young and my brain wired based on my experiences of the world around me, I learned that this was a very effective strategy for minimizing psychological discomfort.
Because of this, over time my threshold for what constituted compartment creation lowered as I relied more and more on this coping mechanism.
Because I was able to compartmentalize my experience, I subconsciously learned to separate the good aspects of my life&mdash;like emotions of happiness, contentment, and happy memories&mdash;from the bad aspects of my life&mdash;like anger, grief, and memories of trauma.
Additionally, I learned to use compartmentalization in areas of my life that weren&rsquo;t inherently traumatic.
While this started as a very effective coping mechanism in response to childhood trauma, it has rapidly turned maladaptive as I have continually created compartments to respond to adult stressors.</p>
<p>Rather than fluidly being able to access all aspects of my personality like a more integrated individual, I have to switch between discrete personality states as I move throughout life.
While many of these compartments share memory (i.e., when I am in one compartment of memory, I will likely remember at least most of what happened when I was in a different compartment of memory), when I switch between compartments it can feel like a RAM drop&mdash;my working memory, or what I was actively thinking about, gets wiped.
I also have compartments of memory with varying degrees of amnesia between them, so I genuinely may not remember what happened when I was in one compartment when I&rsquo;m in a different compartment. This lack of memory sharing typically happens between compartments who hold traumatic memories and emotions and ones who do not.
Additionally, depending on which memory compartment I&rsquo;m in, I will have different motivations and awareness of my current life. So while I may be an enthusiastic PhD student in several compartments, I also have compartments where I have no idea what my research is, or even that I am a student working towards my degree.
Sometimes, instead of fully taking over, these compartments intrude on my awareness, so I may have unexplained feelings of, say, fear that I have no idea where is coming from or what is triggering it.</p>
<p>For a long time, I was adamant that I did not experience identity alteration. I&rsquo;m now realizing that while I do have many compartments that all seem to identify as &ldquo;me&rdquo;, some compartments are so far removed from present time and context that, when I am in them, I do not perceive myself as being the adult me I actually am.
The identity alteration I do experience is incredibly subtle, and is much more an internal phenomena than an external one&mdash;an external observer will most likely not be able to tell apart my parts <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. These parts are just different versions of me, so even with the identity alteration I do have, I see these parts as all being <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>So DID is really not <em>about</em> identity, even if that&rsquo;s the most sensationalized part of the disorder. I personally see the identity alteration and switching/influence of multiple personality states as merely a side effect of a brilliant psychological defense mechanism in response to early childhood trauma. But while it&rsquo;s not about identity explicitly, the fact that one has several distinct identities<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as opposed to a single unified one can be a major component to the disorder that may severely affect, both positively and negatively, how one experiences life with DID.</p>
<!---

For a long time, I was adament that I did not experience identity alteration. I'm now realizing that while I do have many compartments that all seem to identify as "me", some compartments are so far removed from present time and context that, when I am in them, I do not perceive myself as being the adult me I actually am. 
I now see my initial attempts to deny my identity alteration as a way of denying that I do, in fact, have DID, and once again used my coping mechanisms to shove that knowledge out of my awareness. This is because coming to terms with having DID means coming to terms with having childhood trauma, and while that was once too hard for me to accept, I am beginning to accept it now.



Denial is a major part of this disorder, and one year and two months into therapy, I'm still coming to terms with the fact that I utilized this effective coping strategy in response to childhood trauma, which is known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. d
Denial is a major part of this disorder, and one year and two months into therapy, I'm still coming to terms with this.

So DID is really not about identity---it's about childhood trauma and the extreme compartmentalization that may form because of it. 
This only scratches the surface of what I experience as a results of having DID.
There are many occasions that I have been shocked to hear how I behaved when more vulnerable parts of my personality have been out,.

For example, I have parts that clean for me, because at one time I likely decided that although I really didn't want to clean, I needed to, so I created a part to do so for me. 

While this was an incredibly effective coping strategy for me when I was actively experiencing trauma, it 

This has been an incredibly effective strategy in emotional regulation for me. In fact, my dynamic range of emotions is so low, that my main emotional state exists solely of mild contentment, which I seemingly experience most of the time.



On this blog, I hope to document my experiences as a system of memory compartments, which I like to call parts, working together in the relay race of life in an attempt to live it to the fullest.



Because this compartment creation strategy has been my primary coping mechanism, as time went on, I created more and more compartments as a response to small life stressors, which has been unsustainable. 
 an unsustainable 

Detaching from the world around me allowed me to regulate how much of my surroundings I experienced, which has been particularly helpful as an autistic person with sound and light sensitivities.
Over time, rather than the standard development of a fluid personality with a singular sense of "me", I developed several discretely separated personality states that I need to switch between to experience life.

Because of the internal compartmentalization, the parts of me who lived a normal childhood did not remember the events that occurred to the parts of me who experienced trauma. This allowed my compartments that experienced life to grow and thrive as a child, while my other compartments held the hurt and pain of the abuse. 
This led to 

While many individuals with this disorder may only experience a split in traumatized vs untraumatized parts of their personality, 

As I became older and was no longer actively encountering abuse, because it was so deeply engrained in how I operate, I still used this part creation strategy to aid in every day life.

Detaching from the world around me was a way I learned to regulate myself. For example, because I am autistic, I have sound and light sensitivities.

This became a highly effective strategy---I learned to dedicate parts of me to handling abuse, and other parts of me to learning and growing as a child.

When I started therapy almost 14 months ago, I genuinely believed that dissociative identity disorder (DID) was a fake disorder that people feigned to get out of trouble or for attention. My understanding of DID was influenced by the social and traditional media representation of the disorder, which generally portrayed people experiencing drastic personality shifts, or seemingly role-playing characters. I never thought this disorder could apply to me---for the most part, I was soft spoken, reclusive, and tried my hardest to blend into society. However, as I know now, I am a typical, but not stereotypical, example of how DID presents.

<p>This example is an oversimplification, and this severe abuse occurred outside the home. However, I did experience less severe abuse and other traumas within my family which shaped my development of this disorder as well.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This was not fully the case, but I wanted to emphasize the differential between the good and bad parts of my childhood to provide a more concrete example of how parts in DID may split.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>For the most part, I still can&rsquo;t even tell apart my parts. This is something that I&rsquo;m sure I will get better at with time, as I get more acquainted with how I operate.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>These distinct indentities are not whole on their own. Rather, they represent different parts of my whole personality. Rather than having one unified identity, I have several fragmented identities/personality states that I switch between.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
