                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The word I like best to describe my flavor of DID is polyfragmented.
Polyfragmented is most commonly referred to to mean someone who has a lot of parts and/or splits parts in a complex manner. I believe I exhibit both.</p>
<p>In a more traditional case of DID, it is my understanding that a person has a relatively small number parts that are more well defined. They only have a few compartments of memory, thus allowing them to spend more time in each compartment, so each compartment has more time to develop a distinct way of being. Their switches between these parts seem to be more pronounced since each part is more well defined.</p>
<p>I believe I experience something different. In addition to having several well-developed main parts, I also seem to have many fragments, or much less developed parts. It seems like, for the most part, these parts represent smaller fractions of my life than someone with a more traditional presenting form of DID. I have more parts, along with more fragmentation and less differentiation since each part had less time to develop a distinct identity.</p>
<p>Why do I have so many parts? I believe it&rsquo;s because the threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals&mdash;things that would be considered traumatic to me may not affect another person as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, life experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, because I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there&rsquo;s a high correlation between those who are polyfragmented and are autistic <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned that I have many different splitting patterns.
One such splitting pattern is that, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to split many parts in a sequential manner.
I also do not only split parts due to trauma&mdash;I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rather than working with one part at a time, I&rsquo;m working with clusters of parts at any given time<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
I do not seem to have a &ldquo;host&rdquo;, or primary, personality. Instead, I have one of a few clusters of parts active at any given time, which seem to change from week-to-week and month-to-month in a cyclical pattern.
My parts do not have names&mdash;they have labels<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
I shift and switch<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> between these parts at least a few dozen times a day, even without being triggered, because I have parts I need to access as a normal part of every day living.
Since my threshold for creating parts is so low, I believe I am still creating parts in the present-day.
My system isn&rsquo;t neatly organized and structured. It&rsquo;s chaotic, messy, and unknown.</p>
<p>Now, while this may sound like a difficult way to live&mdash;and in many aspects it certainly is&mdash;I believe the language used to describe this disorder makes it sound a lot more severe than it feels internally, at least to me. Many of my parts share memory and are cooperative with one another. But because of my system structure, I struggle with many aspects of time and memory, such as knowing what day, month, or sometimes year it is when I wake up in the morning, remembering what I did yesterday, or even 5 minutes ago, and losing anywhere from days to weeks of time due to a trauma trigger.
However, I have had DID my entire life, and I have, for the most part, lived a conventionally successful life despite this. I know no other way of living&mdash;this is normal to me.
Only since learning that I have DID and gaining the language to describe my experiences did I know the way I experience the world is different from most others, and could be considered disordered. However, this is my normal, and always has been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me just over a year of therapy to get to the awareness I have today, and I know there&rsquo;s so much more I&rsquo;m unaware of. At the very begining of my journey to discovering how I operate, I never could have imagined that I had this chaotic of a system.
Internally, I feel fine, and generally okay. When I take a step back and look at the facts of my situation, I can objectively see that I should be having a difficult time right now. However, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview.
My body is designed to deal with trauma, and learning about and working with my messy system could be considered just another trauma I&rsquo;m getting through.</p>
<p>Having polyfragmented DID makes my life very chaotic. I do not know how many parts I have, nor do I think I will ever know. I have to be okay with the unknown and be open minded about the information I learn about my system. I&rsquo;ve always lived this way&mdash;I just wasn&rsquo;t aware about it until now.</p>
<!--
Right now, as I write this, 
up until recently, I was just as dysfunctional, but I didn't know I was because I didn't know I had DID and daily amnesia. Now that I am much more aware of what is going on in my life, I have full confidence that I will become more functional again soon. I have been very functional living with this disorder in the recent past, so I have full faith I'll get there again, this time with much more awareness of how I operate.






I seem to use parts differently than the most-shared representations of DID portray. Because of this, it took me an incredibly long time to see in myself that I had DID. 






I'd like to note that while I use the word "dysfunctional" to describe myself, I'm actually very high-functioning in most areas of my life. 
I use the word dysfunctional to describe the fact that this disorder is impacting my day-to-day functioning, making it hard to do the things I want to do. This is because my internal awareness is so fragmented that I do not have continuity of memory, and I have clusters of parts with different interests trying to live life in different ways, causing internal division. However, in many aspects of life, I am living functionally.



I'm using my dissociative coping mecahanisms to protect me from what could be objectively considered a difficult time, just as I have in the past. For the most part, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview. Dissociation is an amazing coping mechanism. 


For what it's worth, the labels I use to describe how I function make it seem like my life is a lot worse than it actually is. Despite the internal chaos and amnesia, I, for the most part, enjoy how I operate. I realize 

Thus, when I am triggered in the present day, I have to switch between a series of parts in rapid succession before switching back to an untraumatized part.
I am also able to take care of myself well, but 


This is the most descriptive word I've found used in the literature and online communities that represents how I experience having DID.
Most of my parts share memory between them, so switching/shifting can almost be undetectable to me. However, I do experience amnesia between some parts that come out nearly daily.
I seem to split parts easily and in a complex manner. 

With these splitting patterns, this means I have a lot of parts.

When I was young, I likely would not qualify as polyframented---my rate of part creation has increased as I aged 

I seem to have parts created to do jobs for me. For example, I have a few different parts dedicated to cleaning, a part for brushing my showering, and even a sequence of parts dedicated to getting me from putting my VR headset on to in my VR game as quickly/without my awareness as possible. My definition of what constitutes part creation is so low that a game loading screen made me create parts.

This is not a word I've seen in the academic literature, although Richard Kluft seems to describe similar phenomena in one of his papers[^1], so it's not concretely defined. To me, the word polyfragmented means a person who has many parts and/or splits them in a complex fashion. I believe I fall under the category of both. 
Because my understanding of DID was that of a more traditional presentation, I initially did not believe I had this disorder, despite having clear cases of amnesia. However, over time, I found that my presentation was simply different to the traditional presentation. It seems as though I 


rather than having a relatively few number of well-defined parts, 


Reading about experiences of people who self-identify as polyfragmented helped me to see that this label makes the most sense to me.

Because I switch so much, my relationship with time 

Rather than a few clearly defined parts, it seems as though my entire personality is split into multiple parts

My internal experience is extremely compartmentalized. When my symptoms are bad, I'm often living day-to-day, or even moment-to-moment, unaware of what I had previously been doing or what my next plans are. I feel like I'm in a state of survival---I just need to get through this moment onto the next day. This was a mindset I used as a child when I had to get through my current situation, but trusted there were good times ahead. I'd do whatever I could to pass time, to distract myself of the present moment so once the good times came, I could 

When times are good, 

However, in my adult life, this is a 
When I began graduate school, everything was stressful, and I was nearly constantly in this living moment-to-moment mindset, unable to take a step back and examine that 


I relied upon as a child to get me through times that were extremely stressful---I perceived the present moment as being bad, but I had faith that in the future. I used this when I had to get through a situation that took a long time

---the present moment is bad, but maybe the future will be better. I just need to get through this present moment to getas long as I could make it through the present moment, maybe the next. 

It took me several months of therapy with a dissociative disorders specialist in order for me to even consider that I had DID, despite having a pediatric dissociative disorder diagnosis. Like many others would in my generation, as soon as I realized I was being assessed for DID, I immediately went to sites like Reddit and YouTube to see how other people with this disorder conceptualize their experiences. Needless to say, I did not relate to others' experiences that I found online. Most people I had encountered seemed to have a relatively small number clearly defined parts with clear roles. I genuinely did not believe that I had DID, despite the fact that I was frequently dissociating in therapy sessions without realizing I was doing so. 

Why do I have so many parts? The threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals---things that would be considered traumatic to me may not have affected another child as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, along with the fact that I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there's a high correlation of those who are polyfragmented and have autism.

What does this mean? It is my understanding that typically, individuals with DID split a few to several well defined parts---they don't have too many different compartments they switch between.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was 12, I stopped feeling anxiety. Prior to that, I was a child ravished by anxiety. Then, one day, it stopped <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. And I have never experienced anxiety in the same way since.</p>
<p>I now understand that anxiety is one of the experiences that I dissociated away&mdash;it&rsquo;s a state that I did not enjoy experiencing, so I learned how to compartmentalize it and push it out of my awareness.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not <em>experience</em> anxiety; rather, it means that when I do, I am so detached from it that I do not experience all aspects of it.</p>
<p>My body trembles, lower lip quivers, and heart races, yet I don&rsquo;t know why I am experiencing these physical symptoms.
My mind races with irrational thought loops, yet I can&rsquo;t quite grasp onto them so they feel like meaningless noise to me.
I am disconnected and emotionally numb. Except for when I am not.</p>
<p>When I am able to connect with the feeling of anxiety, it is all-encompassing and feels everlasting. When something triggers anxiety to the forefront of my awareness, it is all I can concentrate on, and I will do whatever I need to do to alleviate the feeling. Then, all of a sudden, it goes away as quickly as it came, and after it&rsquo;s over I gradually forget that it ever happened.</p>
<p>Right now, as I write this, I do not know what anxiety feels like. Parts of me do, but I am not connected with those parts. For the most part, I feel like an emotionless machine, going through the motions of life. Despite the fact that I&rsquo;m unable to connect with anxiety, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t affect me. My behaviors are controlled by fear and anxiety that I cannot feel&mdash;I can only intellectually infer that I am being affected by anxiety by examining my behaviors. I avoid leaving my apartment, interacting with others, and doing things that may eventually lead to stressful situations. Yet I do not experience the associated emotions with these behaviors&mdash;I am numb.</p>
<p>When I was 12, I didn&rsquo;t become a less anxious person&mdash;I just became more detached from my anxiety. My crippling anxiety wasn&rsquo;t miraculously cured. Instead, it was like fixing a wound that needed stitches with a band-aid&mdash;an easy, temporary solution that left me worse-off in the long term.</p>
<p>In order to decrease my amnesia and regain control of my life, I need to connect back with my anxiety.
Although it allows me to avoid difficult feelings in the moment, my current method of dealing with anxiety&mdash;compartmentalizing it and shoving it from my awareness&mdash;leads to uncontrollable fear-based behavior, a lack of internal awareness, and amnesia. I need to connect with this destabilizing experience once again, this time working though it instead of shoving it from my awareness. Then, I can address its root causes and gain control of my life again.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have always been nerdy. From a young age, I immersed myself in academic work, as I enjoyed learning and the strict routine that school provided for me. I also had an intense need to perform well&mdash;my perfectionistic tendencies dominated my life as a child. While I often did perform well academically, there were times where I performed markedly poorly on assessments, so far outside the norm of what would have ordinarily be expected of me, despite preparing and knowing the material. For example, one one occasion in high school, I was so prepared for an exam that I helped tutor my friends about the material leading up to it, only for me to fail while they performed well. I wasn&rsquo;t ordinarily a bad test taker&mdash;I genuinely didn&rsquo;t understand the material when exam time came. To put it simply, there were times when I was smart, and times when I was&hellip; not. I  now understand this to be as a result of having DID.</p>
<p>Some of my parts were formed when I was a small child. When I am in these compartments, although I may be aware that I am an adult, I typically have the mental ability of around the age in which those parts developed. These compartments are essentially snapshots of my mindset at the time they were created, with varying levels of awareness of the present day. One major implication of this is that my ability to understand information varies depending on which compartment of awareness I am in. For example, I have a younger, very timid part that sometimes comes out that has the math ability of a middle schooler. When this part is active, I am unable to grasp onto the complex topics required of me for my PhD that I can normally do with relative ease when the right part of me is active. I am not aware of what I do not know, believing what I know in that moment is all that I do know. This part of me often comes out around others while I&rsquo;m supposed to be having intellectual discussions. The results are humiliating&mdash;I am unable to discuss even my own research, which the right parts of me are very familiar with. Many a time I have left a meeting feeling absolutely defeated and frustrated that I was unable to discuss my research properly. However, there were other times, when the correct parts were out, that I was very much able to hold an academic discussion about my work. My fluctuating knowledge of my work has detrimentally impacted my academic career thus far.</p>
<!--
, but now that I'm aware of the problem, I see the path forward in how to improve.

Becoming aware that I have DID has offered a much-needed explanation for why my brain works in this way. -->
<p>Before I knew I had DID, I never questioned my fluctuating levels of intelligence. However, I did come up with a justification for my poor performance&mdash;when I was in compartments that weren&rsquo;t aware of my more academic parts, I truly believed that I was dumber than all of my peers. That, somehow, any time I had performed well I had cheated, and I faked my way to where I am today as a PhD student. There are times where I&rsquo;d look at my academic papers, ones that I had written, and not only did I not understand what the material was about, but I didn&rsquo;t fully remember writing them. I developed extreme imposter syndrome as a result of this&mdash;I truly didn&rsquo;t feel like I belonged in my institution, and I believed that I had genuine reasons as to why.</p>
<p>It has only been within the last several months that I&rsquo;ve been able to identify when I&rsquo;m in a compartment of awareness that is not necessarily able to understand the material required of me in order to complete my degree, and I now see that the difference in ability is pronounced. When this part of me is active, I now stop working and try to understand why it is out. What is preventing me from accessing the compartments of me that do work? Sometimes the answer is obvious; other times, I&rsquo;m not so sure. Most frequently, however, I don&rsquo;t realize that a non-academic part has been out until after it has already gone. I&rsquo;m still trying to understand these parts of myself, but just knowing that my having DID explains much of my academic distress really helps me understand why I am the way that I am.</p>

In a PhD program[^1], other than one's thesis defense that is the capstone of their degree, the qualifying exam is the most important test of one's degree. The qualifying exam typically occurs a year or two into the degree, and is meant to assess if one is qualified to continue in the PhD program. What exactly a qualifying exam consists of differs from school to school, and department to department. In my program, my qualifying exam was a "chalk talk"---you choose three topics of concentration, and three experts on those fields will ask you questions which you answer on the chalk board. They assess your responses and determine if you're qualified to continue in the degree.

[^1]: Ones I am familiar with in the USA.


In high school. I wasn't aware I had DID. But looking back with the awareness I now have, there are many instances of fluctuating intelligence that can be perfectly explained by having DID. My freshman year, I had a turbulent home environment


For example, in high school, there were times where I'd teach my friends material that would be on the exam, and then I'd do poorly on the exam while they would do well.

My qualifying exam


I do not have access to my full set of knowledge and skills, and 
When this part of me is active

I can feel the intelligence differential between myself and others around me. Over time, when I was in that compartment 



There are some things in life that just made so much more sense after I realized I had DID. Probably the most frustrating one was my fluctuating intelligence. This explained how I could teach my friends the material for a math exam and subsequently fail it while my friends did well. 

I have a complicated relationship with academics.
As a PhD student, 

One of the most frustrating symptoms that falls under the category of _symptoms I've had my entire life but didn't realize_ is flucutating intelligence.

My intelligence, 

This is, perhaps, one of the most frustrating parts of having DID.
