                    <description><![CDATA[<p>One impactful but not immediately obvious symptom of DID for me is that I do not seem to have a continuous internal sense of time&mdash;my awareness of my life is shuffled.
Because of this, I may have a hard time differentiating what happened yesterday versus what happened last week or last month,
or struggle with remembering if, for example, I have leftovers in my fridge now or if that was from weeks ago.
This has made things like tracking changes in my environment difficult.
For example, I have had spring-time allergies for much of my life, but I was unable to realize that until recently&mdash;every day in the spring, I&rsquo;d wake up with allergies, but to me that was just accepted as fact. I didn&rsquo;t remember that I had allergies yesterday or every day last week, or that I didn&rsquo;t have allergies last fall, or that I&rsquo;ve had allergies every spring since childhood. All I am aware of is that I have allergies in that moment. Only since concretely tracking my symptoms this year was I able to determine that I do have springtime allergies, despite having them for years.
Life really feels like a blur to me.</p>
<p>I believe these experiences can be explained by my system structure, and
are heavily impacted by the fact that I am <a href="/posts/polyfragmented">polyfragmented</a>.
I seem to shift and switch between compartments a significant amount on a daily basis, and many of these compartments, or parts, only seem to come out every few days or weeks. Since what is at the forefront of my awareness depends on which memory compartment I&rsquo;m in, and many of these parts only come out once in a while, the end result seems to be that my understanding of my life is very shuffled.</p>
<p>Right now, I have a hard time differentiating between these parts, which makes it difficult to map how my understanding of my life is shuffled. I can vaguely tell when the last time I was in an active compartment was because I remember those memories most prominently, but I don&rsquo;t know <em>who</em> the part is. Many of them feel the same except for mild memory differences, seemingly because I have low identity alteration.
I have been told that differentiating between parts takes time, so I am hopeful that I&rsquo;ll soon be able to identify my parts.
I&rsquo;ve been operating like this for my entire life without awareness that most others do not have such a shuffled awareness.
I&rsquo;m glad that I finally understand that I have DID and that I operate in this way, as it provides me language to contextualize my experiences. With time, I hope to gain a more broad view of my life and form a more continuous relationship with time.</p>
<!--In undergrad, I had two main handwritings, but in grad school my handwriting has become much more inconsistent. Furthermore, because of the way I've split work parts, I can see in my academic journal that, over the span of several months, I'm writing the same things down over and over again, all in different handwritings. I'm trying really 

These experiences are just subtle enough for me to question if they are actually significant, or if everyone experiences them and I'm just hyperaware of my internal experience. It's taken me a while, but now that I know how DID affects me, I do believe that these experiences are significant, as they do impact my day-to-day functioning.


When I wake up in the morning, I never know which part of me will be active---it seems to be different most days, so I wake up almost every morning with a different internal sense of how to operate in the world. Throughout the day, as other parts come out, my priorities and interests are shifted elsewhere, directed by what the current part wants to be doing. Externally observing my behavior, when I'm alone I discretely switch from task to task in a somewhat chaotic manner.
Because I only have the awareness of the current part, this jumpy behavior feels natural to me as I follow my switches.


cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday. 

My plants in my home don't seem to grow---to me, it appears like they abruptly jump in size. 


I now have way more parts than jobs. For example, I went from having two main work parts in my undergraduate years to an uncountable number of work parts in graduate school[^1], making 
[^1] I can see this by looking at my handwriting

When I switch, it can feel like a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I just left off. Because I do not have much differentiation between my parts[^3], I often don't realize I've switched---I may just abruptly do something different to what I've previously been doing without awareness that I should be doing something else. For example, I may be working and switch to a part with no awareness of work, so I'll go do something else while that part is out and it's only when I switch to a part with awareness of work do I realize I wasn't working when I should have been. 
[^3]: I'm actively working on learning how to internally differentiate between my parts so I can sort this mess out.


I have an extremely constricted, compartmentalized awareness so that at any given time, I only have a partial understanding of my entire life, and my ability to track time between parts varies. 


It seems like I only have a full sense of time surrounding the compartment I currently am in, and when I switch between compartments it can feel like time restarts[^1].
[^1]: This seems to depend on how much the parts are familiar with each other. Some switches, which I like to call shifts, feel nearly seamless, while others, between parts who have more amnesia for each other, can feel more jarring.

For most of my life, having such a constricted awareness has been useful.
For example, as a child, this allowed me to have a compartment for when I was in an abusive situation, and a different compartment for when I was at school. Separating these experiences was beneficial---it made it so that when I was at school I had no awareness of my abusive environment, so it didn't affect me as much.
When I was in school, I was able to focus on school, and when I was in an abusive situation, I was able to focus my energy on getting through it. Separating these worlds allowed me to learn and grow as a child while simultaneously experiencing abuse. 
It seems like the shuffling of my sense of time is a side effect of my constricted awareness.

Now as an adult, I've continued to live my life in such a compartmentalized way that I'm only fully aware of what is currently going on in the compartment I am in---I've learned to live life in the moment-to-moment, without a more broad awareness of my past and future.

This level of constricted awareness has made my day-to-day functioning difficult.

I learned how to split parts and compartmentalize experiences as a coping mechanism as a young child, and because it was so effective, I've continued to use it as an adult. For me, what started as a beneficial coping mechanism seems to have gone out of control as I've used this strategy to cope with adult stressors. As a result, I now have many parts that I switch between on a regular basis with varying degrees of awareness between them. When I was younger, I seemed to have a much more structured and organized system, with each part having a unique job. Now, my system is much more chaotic, with multiple parts vying for the same job. So, for example, I have multiple different work parts that don't have full communication between them, so I can do one session of work as one part and then when I inevitably switch to a different work part, I may have difficulty picking up where the last part took off. This wasn't always the case---for most of my undergraduate years, I only had 2 main work parts who seemed to work well together. I only created many work parts when my work became a major source of stress in graduate school. Now, I have countless work parts with that don't have full awareness between them[^2].

[^2]: This can be verified by looking how my handwriting has changed through the years.
Externally, this appears that I am slacking on my work responsibilities, but in reality the intention is different---sometimes I genuinely do not know I am supposed to be working.

However, the way I seem to experience this is incredibly subtle.
How does this affect me?
it allows me to only be aware of the activities current environment that I am in. 
 It seems as though if Part A is active for  a period of time and Part B takes over, when Part A is active again (or, when I am in Part A's compartment of memory again), stuff that occurred when Part B was out feels like it occured longer ago than when Part A was active.
I suspect that others with more identity alteration would 

These experiences are just subtle enough for me to question if they are actually significant, or if everyone experiences them and I'm just being . 
Because the way I navigate throughout life involves switching between compartments of memory, and when I'm in one compartment I may remember different things about my life due to what I experienced while I was in that compartment of memory in the past, my awareness at any given time is constricted.

When the abused part was out, I would be able to focus all of my energy on minimizing the abuse, 

. What exactly I'm aware of depends on which memory compartment I'm in.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The word I like best to describe my flavor of DID is polyfragmented.
Polyfragmented is most commonly referred to to mean someone who has a lot of parts and/or splits parts in a complex manner. I believe I exhibit both.</p>
<p>In a more traditional case of DID, it is my understanding that a person has a relatively small number parts that are more well defined. They only have a few compartments of memory, thus allowing them to spend more time in each compartment, so each compartment has more time to develop a distinct way of being. Their switches between these parts seem to be more pronounced since each part is more well defined.</p>
<p>I believe I experience something different. In addition to having several well-developed main parts, I also seem to have many fragments, or much less developed parts. It seems like, for the most part, these parts represent smaller fractions of my life than someone with a more traditional presenting form of DID. I have more parts, along with more fragmentation and less differentiation since each part had less time to develop a distinct identity.</p>
<p>Why do I have so many parts? I believe it&rsquo;s because the threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals&mdash;things that would be considered traumatic to me may not affect another person as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, life experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, because I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there&rsquo;s a high correlation between those who are polyfragmented and are autistic <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned that I have many different splitting patterns.
One such splitting pattern is that, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to split many parts in a sequential manner, which leads to a lot of parts being created for a single event.
I also do not only split parts due to trauma&mdash;I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rather than working with one part at a time, I&rsquo;m working with clusters of parts at any given time<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
I do not seem to have a &ldquo;host&rdquo;, or primary, personality. Instead, I have one of a few clusters of parts active at any given time, which seem to change from week-to-week and month-to-month in an approximate cyclical pattern.
My parts do not have names&mdash;they have labels<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
I shift and switch<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> between these parts at least a few dozen times a day, even without being triggered, because I have parts I need to access as a normal part of every day living<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.
Since my threshold for creating parts is so low, I believe I am still creating parts in the present-day.
My system isn&rsquo;t neatly organized and structured. It&rsquo;s chaotic, messy, and unknown.</p>
<p>Now, while this may sound like a difficult way to live&mdash;and in many aspects it certainly is&mdash;I believe the language used to describe this disorder makes it sound a lot more severe than it feels internally, at least to me.
I have had DID my entire life, and I have, for the most part, lived an enjoyable and conventionally successful life despite this. I know no other way of living&mdash;this is normal to me.
However, because of my system structure, I struggle with many aspects of time and memory<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, such as knowing what day, month, or sometimes year it is when I wake up in the morning, remembering what I did yesterday, or even 5 minutes ago, and losing anywhere from minutes to weeks of time due to a trauma trigger.
My internal awareness of my life is also shuffled, so I may have a hard time differentiating what happened yesterday versus what happened last week or last month, or struggle with remembering if, for example, a cold I have today is new or if I was also sick yesterday.
It can feel like every day a reset button in my brain is pressed, and I start all over instead of picking up where I left off yesterday.
This can affect my daily functioning significantly.
Only since learning that I have DID and gaining the language to describe my experiences did I know the way I experience the world is different from most others, and could be considered disordered. However, this is my normal, and always has been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me just over a year of therapy to get to the awareness I have today, and I know there&rsquo;s so much more I&rsquo;m unaware of.
When I take a step back and look at the facts of my situation, I can objectively see that I should be having a difficult time right now. However, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview.
My body is designed to deal with trauma, and learning about and working with my messy system could be considered just another trauma I&rsquo;m getting through.</p>
<p>Having polyfragmented DID makes my life very chaotic. I do not know how many parts I have, nor do I think I will ever know. I have to be okay with the unknown and be open minded about the information I learn about my system. I&rsquo;ve always lived this way&mdash;I just wasn&rsquo;t aware about it until now.</p>
