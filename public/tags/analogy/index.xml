                    <description><![CDATA[<p>DID can be difficult to understand.
One of my favorite analogies for DID is from Janina Fisher&rsquo;s <em>Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors</em>, pgs 149-150:</p>





<div class="paige-quote">
    <blockquote class="blockquote">Your parts developed a relay race system for surviving your childhood: one would grab the baton and run the next leg of the &lsquo;race,&rsquo; while others were shielded from what was happening, and then another would grab the baton and run the next leg. It was automatic: the best &lsquo;runner&rsquo; for a particular situation would be instinctivly activated to run that leg, then the best runner for the next leg of the race would be triggered, and so on. No one was distracted by how the others were running because each was separate and had little to no awareness of the others.</blockquote>

<p>I relate a lot to this analogy. Before I became more self-aware, I was only able to hold the perspective of the part I currently was, and didn&rsquo;t realize that my understanding and perception of the world changed depending on which part of me was active. When I would analyze my past memories, I would only be aware of the feelings and actions of the part I currently was, for the most part not taking into account my experiences that didn&rsquo;t align with the currently active part. I had multiple separate threads of experience that I would switch between without awareness.</p>
<p>Now that I am more aware of how I operate, my goal is to be able to take a step back from the compartment that I currently am in to be able to have a broader picture of my life.
In the year and two months I&rsquo;ve been in therapy, my awareness has increased dramatically, but I still have a long way to go.
One of the hardest parts has been accepting that I am a team rather than the solo runner I always thought I was.</p>
<!--

I would switch from part to part without awareness, and, although I didn't know it at the time, I was living life moment-to-moment, without much awareness of what had happened in the past or what I wanted to do in the future. 

As I understand it now, 
when one part of me is active, memories formed when different parts were active feel different---they distinctly feel like _not me_. How much they feel like _not me_ seems to vary depending on how connected two parts are. For example, a part of me that works may not remember traumatic memory at all, and may have a vague awareness of my memories formed while I was on vacation, and would be much more connected with memories that different work parts formed. In fact, if one were to ask me about my vacation from a month ago while a work part is active, I will likely only have a general awareness of what occurred during that trip and would have to switch to a part more familiar with the vacation in order to converse more.

This is an incredibly subtle feeling, 
Moment-to-moment, I generally have a continuous sense of "I"; that is, I don't generally have discrete jumps in 



if I remember what I did when a different part of me was active, the memory feels different from memories that belong to the current version of me. It feels distinctly like memories of other parts do not belong to _me_; they're someone else's. This is an incredibly subtile distinction, and one of the main ways I use to tell apart me parts. Moment-to-moment, I always feel like _me_; I don't really experience discrete jumps in 

---I don't perceive a differential. The main way I'm able to tell that I'm a different part is looking at the past rather than 

Whatever version of me is currently active feels like me, and the only version of me. It took me a long time to realize this, because it's an incredibly subtle distinction. 


One of the ways I like to think about how I experience life is to think that I'm made up of a team of parts working together to live life. 
Now, I understand that who I am right now isn't who I always am---things like my views, interests, mannerisms, and, perhaps most obviously, handwriting change depending on which part of me in the relay race of life is holding the baton. 
It's been difficult trying to conceptualize my experience with DID. The analogy of "multiple people living in the same body" that many people use doesn't seem to make sense for me. In fact, because of this, I actively denied that having DID for several months after starting therapy with the justification that I do not relate to others' experiences I learn about online. 
With this analogy, people with DID seem to feel as though they are the current part that is out, and that parts they could be at other times are "other" to them.
