Polyfragmented is most commonly referred to to mean someone who has a lot of parts and/or splits parts in a complex manner. I believe I exhibit both. In a more traditional case of DID, it is my understanding that a person has a relatively small number parts that are more well defined. They only have a few compartments of memory, thus allowing them to spend more time in each compartment, so each compartment has more time to develop a distinct way of being. Their switches between these parts seem to be more pronounced since each part is more well defined. I believe I experience something different. In addition to having several well-developed main parts, I also seem to have many fragments, or much less developed parts. It seems like, for the most part, these parts represent smaller fractions of my life than someone with a more traditional presenting form of DID. I have more parts, along with more fragmentation and less differentiation since each part had less time to develop a distinct identity. Why do I have so many parts? I believe it’s because the threshold for what constitutes part creation is lower for me than it is for other individuals—things that would be considered traumatic to me may not affect another person as much. I believe this is due to my innate temperament, life experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, because I am autistic. Anecdotally, it seems like there’s a high correlation between those who are polyfragmented and are autistic 1. I’ve also learned that I have many different splitting patterns. One such splitting pattern is that, when I experience something traumatic, I seem to split many parts in a sequential manner. I also do not only split parts due to trauma—I seem to create parts to alleviate even mild discomfort from my awareness. This is something I developed over time, as my threshold for what constituted part creation lowered as I grew older and subconsciously realized how useful of a coping mechanism creating parts was. That is, I became increasingly more fragmented as the older I became, making me more and more dysfunctional in the real world as I aged2. Rather than working with one part at a time, I’m working with clusters of parts at any given time3. I do not seem to have a “host”, or primary, personality. Instead, I have one of a few clusters of parts active at any given time, which seem to change from week-to-week and month-to-month in a cyclical pattern. My parts do not have names—they have labels4. I shift and switch5 between these parts at least a few dozen times a day, even without being triggered, because I have parts I need to access as a normal part of every day living. Since my threshold for creating parts is so low, I believe I am still creating parts in the present-day. My system isn’t neatly organized and structured. It’s chaotic, messy, and unknown. Now, while this may sound like a difficult way to live—and in many aspects it certainly is—I believe the language used to describe this disorder makes it sound a lot more severe than it feels internally, at least to me. Many of my parts share memory and are cooperative with one another. But because of my system structure, I struggle with many aspects of time and memory, such as knowing what day, month, or sometimes year it is when I wake up in the morning, remembering what I did yesterday, or even 5 minutes ago, and losing anywhere from days to weeks of time due to a trauma trigger. However, I have had DID my entire life, and I have, for the most part, lived a conventionally successful life despite this. I know no other way of living—this is normal to me. Only since learning that I have DID and gaining the language to describe my experiences did I know the way I experience the world is different from most others, and could be considered disordered. However, this is my normal, and always has been. It’s taken me just over a year of therapy to get to the awareness I have today, and I know there’s so much more I’m unaware of. At the very begining of my journey to discovering how I operate, I never could have imagined that I had this chaotic of a system. Internally, I feel fine, and generally okay. When I take a step back and look at the facts of my situation, I can objectively see that I should be having a difficult time right now. However, I feel emotionally detached and have an overall positive worldview. My body is designed to deal with trauma, and learning about and working with my messy system could be considered just another trauma I’m getting through. Having polyfragmented DID makes my life very chaotic. I do not know how many parts I have, nor do I think I will ever know. I have to be okay with the unknown and be open minded about the information I learn about my system. I’ve always lived this way—I just wasn’t aware about it until now. I came to this conclusion from r/DID and r/OSDD on Reddit ↩︎ That is, until I stop relying solely dissociation as a coping mechanism, which I’m actively working on doing in therapy. ↩︎ Some people call these subsystems. ↩︎ They may have nicknames, but not many do. There are too many of them for it to make sense for them to have names. Plus, naming parts of myself with human names other than my own doesn’t feel comfortable for me. ↩︎ I use switch to denote a hard, discrete change between parts, which usually occurs when I’m triggered and can be disorienting. I use shift to denote a smooth change between parts, which occurs more often than switching for me and can internally feel like a gear shifting in my brain. ↩︎","title":"Why do I call myself “polyfragmented”?"},{"categories":[""],"date":"2023-03-16T19:17:28-04:00","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/posts/anxiety/","tags":["DID","narrative","symptoms"],"text":"When I was 12, I stopped feeling anxiety. Prior to that, I was a child ravished by anxiety. Then, one day, it stopped 1. And I have never experienced anxiety in the same way since. I now understand that anxiety is one of the experiences that I dissociated away—it’s a state that I did not enjoy experiencing, so I learned how to compartmentalize it and push it out of my awareness. This doesn’t mean I do not experience anxiety; rather, it means that when I do, I am so detached from it that I do not experience all aspects of it. My body trembles, lower lip quivers, and heart races, yet I don’t know why I am experiencing these physical symptoms. My mind races with irrational thought loops, yet I can’t quite grasp onto them so they feel like meaningless noise to me. I am disconnected and emotionally numb. Except for when I am not. When I am able to connect with the feeling of anxiety, it is all-encompassing and feels everlasting. When something triggers anxiety to the forefront of my awareness, it is all I can concentrate on, and I will do whatever I need to do to alleviate the feeling. Then, all of a sudden, it goes away as quickly as it came, and after it’s over I gradually forget that it ever happened. Right now, as I write this, I do not know what anxiety feels like. Parts of me do, but I am not connected with those parts. For the most part, I feel like an emotionless machine, going through the motions of life. Despite the fact that I’m unable to connect with anxiety, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect me. My behaviors are controlled by fear and anxiety that I cannot feel—I can only intellectually infer that I am being affected by anxiety by examining my behaviors. I avoid leaving my apartment, interacting with others, and doing things that may eventually lead to stressful situations. Yet I do not experience the associated emotions with these behaviors—I am numb. When I was 12, I didn’t become a less anxious person—I just became more detached from my anxiety. My crippling anxiety wasn’t miraculously cured. Instead, it was like fixing a wound that needed stitches with a band-aid—an easy, temporary solution that left me worse-off in the long term. In order to decrease my amnesia and regain control of my life, I need to connect back with my anxiety. Although it allows me to avoid difficult feelings in the moment, my current method of dealing with anxiety—compartmentalizing it and shoving it from my awareness—leads to uncontrollable fear-based behavior, a lack of internal awareness, and amnesia. I need to connect with this destabilizing experience once again, this time working though it instead of shoving it from my awareness. Then, I can address its root causes and gain control of my life again. My mom reports me having a discrete personality change when this occurred. ↩︎","title":"Anxiety"},{"categories":[""],"date":"2023-03-13T21:52:50-04:00","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/posts/fluctuatingintelligence/","tags":["DID","symptoms","narrative"],"text":"I have always been nerdy. From a young age, I immersed myself in academic work, as I enjoyed learning and the strict routine that school provided for me. I also had an intense need to perform well—my perfectionistic tendencies dominated my life as a child. While I often did perform well academically, there were times where I performed markedly poorly on assessments, so far outside the norm of what would have ordinarily be expected of me, despite preparing and knowing the material. For example, one one occasion in high school, I was so prepared for an exam that I helped tutor my friends about the material leading up to it, only for me to fail while they performed well. I wasn’t ordinarily a bad test taker—I genuinely didn’t understand the material when exam time came. To put it simply, there were times when I was smart, and times when I was… not. I now understand this to be as a result of having DID. Some of my parts were formed when I was a small child. When I am in these compartments, although I may be aware that I am an adult, I typically have the mental ability of around the age in which those parts developed. These compartments are essentially snapshots of my mindset at the time they were created, with varying levels of awareness of the present day. One major implication of this is that my ability to understand information varies depending on which compartment of awareness I am in. For example, I have a younger, very timid part that sometimes comes out that has the math ability of a middle schooler. When this part is active, I am unable to grasp onto the complex topics required of me for my PhD that I can normally do with relative ease when the right part of me is active. I am not aware of what I do not know, believing what I know in that moment is all that I do know. This part of me often comes out around others while I’m supposed to be having intellectual discussions. The results are humiliating—I am unable to discuss even my own research, which the right parts of me are very familiar with. Many a time I have left a meeting feeling absolutely defeated and frustrated that I was unable to discuss my research properly. However, there were other times, when the correct parts were out, that I was very much able to hold an academic discussion about my work. My fluctuating knowledge of my work has detrimentally impacted my academic career thus far. Before I knew I had DID, I never questioned my fluctuating levels of intelligence. However, I did come up with a justification for my poor performance—when I was in compartments that weren’t aware of my more academic parts, I truly believed that I was dumber than all of my peers. That, somehow, any time I had performed well I had cheated, and I faked my way to where I am today as a PhD student. There are times where I’d look at my academic papers, ones that I had written, and not only did I not understand what the material was about, but I didn’t fully remember writing them. I developed extreme imposter syndrome as a result of this—I truly didn’t feel like I belonged in my institution, and I believed that I had genuine reasons as to why. It has only been within the last several months that I’ve been able to identify when I’m in a compartment of awareness that is not necessarily able to understand the material required of me in order to complete my degree, and I now see that the difference in ability is pronounced. When this part of me is active, I now stop working and try to understand why it is out. What is preventing me from accessing the compartments of me that do work? Sometimes the answer is obvious; other times, I’m not so sure. Most frequently, however, I don’t realize that a non-academic part has been out until after it has already gone. I’m still trying to understand these parts of myself, but just knowing that my having DID explains much of my academic distress really helps me understand why I am the way that I am.","title":"Fluctuating intelligence"},{"categories":[""],"date":"2023-03-09T22:14:57-05:00","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/posts/traveling/","tags":["DID","mechanism","narrative"],"text":"Pretty early on in my DID discovery journey, I realized that my handwriting was different depending on which part of me was writing. This was very useful information, as I had taken well-catalogued academic notes for years prior to starting therapy, so I had a solid bank of data of which I could look back on and see which parts of me were active at different times of my life. One thing I quickly noticed was that any time I traveled to a conference, my handwriting changed. And then when I got back, my handwriting changed back to whatever was normal at that time of my life 1. Internally, this also made sense—I tend to index my life by location rather than time. In fact, in all of my notebooks’ index sections, I had added a column for location, in addition to the standard page number and date. My mind likes segmenting my life based on location. Why could this be the case? Why do I create parts when I travel? Looking back at my life story, it actually makes a lot of sense. My first several years of life involved a lot of traveling. Although I was born in the US, when I was just over 2 months old, my family moved to the Middle East for my dad’s job. As a perk of being an expat, my dad’s job paid for two vacations a year—one for rest and relaxation, and another to visit family. Because of this, by my 5th birthday, I had been to 11 different countries between 4 continents, all on separate trips. This sounds like an incredibly fortunate childhood, and while it was, it was also very stressful for me. As an autistic person, I regulate myself by following a strict routine. As an adult, changes in plans are very dysregulating, and usually leave me in a detached dissociated state with difficulty picking up the newly created plans. I can only imagine how dysregulating it was for me as a small child to have my routine entirely upended every several months to travel to a new environment with an unknown routine. I had no option—my family chose to travel, and since within my family structure the emotional landscape was already dominated by others, I had to be an easy child and submit to whatever they wanted. This led to me dissociating and creating parts to handle the traveling for me. This past summer, I went to my first conference while aware that I create parts this way. The night leading up to the event, I remember absolutely dreading the trip, wishing I could back out but knowing that I couldn’t. Then, when the time came, I genuinely enjoyed the conference—the right part showed up for the job. I did, in fact, create a part for this trip, and this was the first part that I was self-aware I was creating. I had no control over it; instead, I observed its creation as I walked into the hotel lobby to check in. A new persona emerged, and was ready to take on whatever routine was required of me for my week-long conference that was just getting started. With that part as the dominant part, other parts came out periodically to do what was required of me, like networking, socializing, and presenting. But this newly created part was the star of the show, helping me create a solid routine I could stick to throughout the week to help keep me regulated. Then, on the last day, once again the dread came—this time, I, as the newly created part, didn’t want to change my routine back again as I was only familiar with the one I had created. However, when I arrived in my apartment after a long journey back, a different part switched in and I was so glad to be home and back again in my standard routine. We traveled to many beautiful locations in my early childhood, and I truly appreciate all the culturally enriching experiences I acquired, which I believe to this day have helped shaped my worldview. I do, however, wish that my parents were more aware of how stressful this was for me as a child. I did not understand the significance of the locations we would visit, and felt as though I was being dragged from place to place without understanding what was going on around me. In pictures of our family vacations, it’s clear that I am dissociating—many of them show me with a blank expression with my eyes glazed over. I learned to regulate myself by dissociating, detaching from the world around me. And these repeated experiences of traveling = part creation have continued throughout my life, increasingly fragmenting my awareness when I take trips. I believe this is a good example of how trauma, but not necessarily abuse, can lead to the formation of DID. I would not consider traveling as much as we did abuse, but it was traumatic because it was too much for me to handle at the developmental stages it occurred in. One could argue that this was neglect or negligence—that my parents weren’t attuned to my emotional needs at the time. However, it does not fit into the category of extreme abuse that is often attributed to the creation of DID. While I do not believe this was the only trauma that caused me to form DID, and some of those traumas would be considered abuse, traveling in the way that we did when I was small had a major impact on how I create parts, and is perhaps the most influential mechanism of part creation in my adult life. My handwriting isn’t usually discretely clear, and is often a blend of many different parts’ handwritings. However, on several trips my handwriting made a clear enough change for me to notice this pattern. ↩︎","title":"Parts are created from trauma, not necessarily abuse"},{"categories":[""],"date":"2023-03-08T14:56:01-05:00","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/posts/relayrace/","tags":["DID","analogy"],"text":"DID can be difficult to understand. One of my favorite analogies for DID is from Janina Fisher’s Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors, pgs 149-150: Your parts developed a relay race system for surviving your childhood: one would grab the baton and run the next leg of the ‘race,’ while others were shielded from what was happening, and then another would grab the baton and run the next leg. It was automatic: the best ‘runner’ for a particular situation would be instinctivly activated to run that leg, then the best runner for the next leg of the race would be triggered, and so on. No one was distracted by how the others were running because each was separate and had little to no awareness of the others. I relate a lot to this analogy. Before I became more self-aware, I was only able to hold the perspective of the part I currently was, and didn’t realize that my understanding and perception of the world changed depending on which part of me was active. When I would analyze my past memories, I would only be aware of the feelings and actions of the part I currently was, for the most part not taking into account my experiences that didn’t align with the currently active part. I had multiple separate threads of experience that I would switch between without awareness. Now that I am more aware of how I operate, my goal is to be able to take a step back from the compartment that I currently am in to be able to have a broader picture of my life. In the year and two months I’ve been in therapy, my awareness has increased dramatically, but I still have a long way to go. One of the hardest parts has been accepting that I am a team rather than the solo runner I always thought I was.","title":"Life is a relay race"},{"categories":[""],"date":"2023-03-06T21:43:08-05:00","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/posts/notaboutidentity/","tags":["DID","identity","mechanism"],"text":"… it’s about childhood trauma. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) can be thought of as a coping mechanism one may develop when they experience repeated trauma in early childhood. It is arguably one of the most misunderstood and controversial mental health conditions, perhaps because it’s been repeatedly sensationalized in the media. Or, maybe because the name and clinical description of the disorder implies that it’s about having multiple identities or personality states. However, these personality states are often incredibly subtle and are instead indicative of a post-traumatic reaction involving severe compartmentalization of experience. DID is a highly individualized disorder which forms based off of one’s reaction to their life experiences. As such, I can only speak for myself and how I personally experience this disorder. While DID can be difficult to understand, it can be thought of as being fundamentally about two psychological phenomena—detachment and compartmentalization. Using myself as an example, when I was small, there were times where I experienced extreme repeated abuse1, but at other times had a happy childhood. While I was being abused, I mentally detached myself from the situation—I disconnected from my body and the external world, choosing instead to escape into my mind to distract myself from a situation I knew no other way to get out of. Perhaps more importantly, I also internally compartmentalized the experience and shoved it from my awareness, effectively allowing me to forget that it even occurred after it was over as I lived an otherwise happy childhood2. Because this abuse occurred repeatedly, I continually used this strategy of switching to the compartment that held the abuse when I experienced triggers that the abuse was going to happen again. Then, when the abuse was over, I would switch back to the compartment that had a happy childhood and was blissfully unaware of the abuse that was taking place. This repeated pattern of switching between compartments further increased my compartmentalization of memory, awareness, experience, and identity. However, this was incredibly protective, as it allowed some parts of me to learn and grow as a child while other parts of me held the difficult memories and feelings of being abused out of awareness. All of this was done on a subconscious level. This strategy of compartmentalization can only develop when trauma occurs in early childhood, while the brain still is rapidly developing and has the capacity to use such defenses. And because I learned to use these defenses when I was very young and my brain wired based on my experiences of the world around me, I learned that this was a very effective strategy for minimizing psychological discomfort. Because of this, over time my threshold for what constituted compartment creation lowered as I relied more and more on this coping mechanism. Because I was able to compartmentalize my experience, I subconsciously learned to separate the good aspects of my life—like emotions of happiness, contentment, and good memories—from the bad aspects of my life—like anger, grief, and memories of trauma. Additionally, I learned to use compartmentalization in areas of my life that weren’t inherently traumatic. While this started as a very effective coping mechanism in response to childhood trauma, it has rapidly turned maladaptive as I have continually created compartments to respond to adult stressors. Rather than fluidly being able to access all aspects of my personality like a more integrated individual, I have to switch between discrete personality states as I move throughout life. While many of these compartments share memory (i.e., when I am in one compartment of memory, I will likely remember at least most of what happened when I was in a different compartment of memory), when I switch between compartments it can feel like a RAM drop—my working memory, or what I was actively thinking about, gets wiped. I also have compartments of memory with varying degrees of amnesia between them, so I genuinely may not remember what happened when I was in one compartment when I’m in a different compartment. This lack of memory sharing typically happens between compartments who hold traumatic memories and emotions and ones who do not. Additionally, depending on which memory compartment I’m in, I will have different motivations and awareness of my current life. So while I may be an enthusiastic PhD student in several compartments, I also have compartments where I have no idea what my research is, or even that I am a student working towards my degree. Sometimes, instead of fully taking over, these compartments intrude on my awareness, so I may have unexplained feelings of, say, fear that I have no idea where is coming from or what is triggering it. For a long time, I was adament that I did not experience identity alteration. I’m now realizing that while I do have many compartments that all seem to identify as “me”, some compartments are so far removed from present time and context that, when I am in them, I do not perceive myself as being the adult me I actually am. I now see my initial attempts to deny my identity alteration as a way of denying that I do, in fact, have DID, and once again used my coping mechanisms to shove that knowledge out of my awareness. This is because coming to terms with having DID means coming to terms with having childhood trauma, and while that was once too hard for me to accept, I am beginning to accept it now. So DID is really not about identity, even if that’s the most sensationalized part of the disorder. I personally see the identity alteration and switching/influence of multiple personality states as merely a side effect of a brilliant psychological defense mechanism in response to early childhood trauma. But while it’s not about identity explicitly, the fact that one has several distinct identities3 as opposed to a single unified one can be a major component to the disorder that may severely affect, both positively and negatively, how one experiences life with DID. This example is an oversimplification, and this extreme abuse occurred outside the home. However, I did experience less severe abuse and other traumas within my family which shaped my development of this disorder as well. ↩︎ This was not fully the case, but I wanted to emphasize the differential between the good and bad parts of my childhood to provide a more concrete example of how parts in DID may split. ↩︎ These distinct indentities are not whole on their own. Rather, they represent different parts of my whole personality. Rather than having one unified identity, I have several fragmented identities/personality states that I switch between. ↩︎","title":"It’s not about identity"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/search/","tags":null,"text":"","title":"Search"}]
